### Understand and use essential tools

1. Programmable completion for bash is provided in the bash-completion module. To install this module:
    ```shell
    sudo dnf install bash-completion
    ```

1. Access a shell prompt and issue commands with correct syntax

    * Common commands and their options, as well as vim usage, are shown below:

        | ci[movement]             | Change inside of given movement |
        | D                        | Delete to end of line           |
        | S                        | Clear current line              |
        | gg / G                   | Move to start / end of buffer   |
        | yy                       | Copy current line               |
        | p                        | Paste copied text after cursor  |
    
1. Use input-output redirection (>, >>, |, 2>, etc.)
    * The default locations for input, output, and error are referred to as standard input (stdin), standard output (stdout), and standard error (stderr).
    
    * Standard input redirection can be done to have a command read the required information from an alternative source, such as a file, instead of the keyboard. For example:
        ```shell
        cat < /etc/cron.allow 
        ```

    * Standard output redirection sends the output generated by a command to an alternative destination, such as a file. For example:
        ```shell
        ll > ll.out
        ```

    * Standard error redirection sends the output generated by a command to an alternative destination, such as a file. For example: 
        ```shell
        echo test 2> outerr.out
        ```

    * Instead of > to create or overwrite, >> can be used to append to a file.

    * To redirect both stdout and stderror to a file:
        ```shell
        echo test >> result.txt 2>&1
        ```

1. Use grep and regular expressions to analyse text
    * The grep command is used to find text. For example:
        ```shell
        grep user100 /etc/passwd
        ```    
    * Common regular expression parameters are shown below:
        | Symbol | Description                                                        |
        |--------|--------------------------------------------------------------------|
        | ^      | Beginning of a line or word                                        |
        | $      | End of a line or word                                              |
        | \|     | Or                                                                 |
        | .      | Any character                                                      |
        | *      | Any number of any character                                        |
        | ?      | Exactly one character                                              |
        | []     | Range of characters                                                |
        | \      | Escape character                                                   |
        | ''     | Mask meaning of enclosed special characters                        |
        | ""     | Mask meaning of all enclosed special characters except \, $ and '' |
    
1. Access remote systems using SSH

    * Secure Shell (SSH) provides a secure mechanism for data transmission between source and destination systems over IP networks.
    
    * SSH uses encryption and performs data integrity checks on transmitted data.
    
    * The version of SSH used is defined in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`.
    
    * The most common authentication methods are Password-Based Authentication and Public/Private Key-Based Authentication.
    
    * The command *ssh-keygen* is used to generate keys and place them in the .ssh directory, and the command *ssh-copy-id* is used to copy the public key file to your account on the remote server.
    
    * TCP Wrappers is a host-based mechanism that is used to limit access to wrappers-aware TCP services on the system by inbound clients. 2 files `/etc/hosts.allow` and `/etc/hosts.deny` are used to control access. The .allow file is referenced before the .deny file. The format of the files is \<name of service process>:\<user@source>.
    
    * All messages related to TCP Wrappers are logged to the `/var/log/secure` file.
    
    * To login using SSH: 
        ```shell
        ssh user@host
        ``` 

1. Log in and switch users in multiuser targets

    * A user can switch to another user using the *su* command. The *-i* option ensures that the target users login scripts are run:
        ```shell
        sudo -i -u targetUser
        ``` 

    * To run a command as root without switching:
        ```shell
        sudo -c
        ``` 

    * The configuration for which users can run which commands using sudo is defined in the `/etc/sudoers` file. The visudo command is used to edit the sudoers file. The sudo command logs successful authentication and command data to `/var/log/secure`.

1. Archive, compress, unpack, and decompress files using tar, star, gzip, and bzip2

    * To archive using tar:
        ```shell
        tar cvf myTar.tar /home
        ``` 

    * To unpack using tar:
        ```shell
        tar xvf myTar.tar
        ``` 

    * To compress using tar and gzip:
        ```shell
        tar cvfz myTar.tar /home
        ``` 

    * To compress using tar and bzip2:
        ```shell
        tar cvfj myTar.tar /home
        ``` 

    * To decompress using tar and gzip:
        ```shell
        tar xvfz myTar.tar /home
        ``` 

    * To decompress using tar and bzip2:
        ```shell
        tar xvfj myTar.tar /home
        ``` 

    * The star command is an enhanced version of tar. It also supports SELinux security contexts and extended file attributes. The options are like tar.


1. Create and edit text files

    * To create an empty file:
        ```shell
        touch file
        cat > newfile
        ``` 

    * To create a file using vim:
        ```shell
        vi file
        ``` 

1. Create, delete, copy, and move files and directories

    * To create a directory:
        ```shell
        mkdir directory
        ``` 

    * To move a file or directory:
        ```shell
        mv item1 item2
        ```     

    * To copy a file or directory:
        ```shell
        cp item1 item2
        ```     

    * To remove a file:
        ```shell
        rm file1
        ```

    * To remove an empty directory:
        ```shell
        rmdir directory
        ```

    * To remove a non-empty directory:
        ```shell
        rm -r directory
        ```

1. Create hard and soft links

    * A soft link associates one file with another. If the original file is removed the soft link will point to nothing. To create a soft link to file1:
        ```shell
        ln -s file1 softlink
        ``` 

    * A hard link associates multiple files to the same inode making them indistinguishable. If the original file is removed, you will still have access to the data through the linked file. To create a soft link to file1:
        ```shell
        ln file1 hardlink
        ``` 

1. List, set, and change standard ugo/rwx permissions

    * Permissions are set for the user, group, and others. User is the owner of the file or the directory, group is a set of users with identical access defined in `/etc/group`, and others are all other users. The types of permission are read, write, and execute.
    
    * Permission combinations are shown below:
        | Octal Value | Binary Notation | Symbolic Notation | Explanation                           |
        |-------------|-----------------|-------------------|---------------------------------------|
        | 0           | 000             | ---               | No permissions.                       |
        | 1           | 001             | --x               | Execute permission only.              |
        | 2           | 010             | -w-               | Write permission only.                |
        | 3           | 011             | -wx               | Write and execute permissions.        |
        | 4           | 100             | r--               | Read permission only.                 |
        | 5           | 101             | r-x               | Read and execute permissions.         |
        | 6           | 110             | rw-               | Read and write permissions.           |
        | 7           | 111             | rwx               | Read, write, and execute permissions. |

    * To grant the owner, group, and others all permissions using the *chmod* command:
        ```shell
        chmod 777 file1
        ```

    * The default permissions are calculated based on the umask. The default umask for root is 0022 and 0002 for regular users (the leading 0 has no significance). The pre-defined initial permissions are 666 for files and 777 for directories. The umask is subtracted from these initial permissions to obtain the default permissions. To change the default umask:
        ```shell
        umask 027
        ```

    * Every file and directory has an owner. By default, the creator assumes ownership. The owner's group is assigned to a file or directory. To change the ownership of a file or directory:
        ```shell
        useradd user100
        chown user100 item1
        chgrp user100 item1
        ```
    
        ```shell
        chown user100:user100 item1
        ```
    * Note that the -R option must be used to recursively change all files in a directory.

1. Locate, read, and use system documentation including man, info, and files in `/usr/share/doc`

    * The *man* command can be used to view help for a command. To search for a command based on a keyword the *apropros* command or *man* with the -k option can be used. The *mandb* command is used to build the man database.

    * To search for a command based on a keyword in occurring in its man page:
        ```shell
        man -K <keyword>
        ```

    * The *whatis* command can be used to search for a command in the man database for a short description.

    * The *info* command provides more detailed information than the *man* command. 

    * The `/usr/share/doc` directory contains documentation for all installed packages under sub-directories that match package names followed by their version.

### Create simple shell scripts

1. Conditionally execute code (use of: if, test, [], etc.)

	* An example using if and test statements is shown with *example.sh* below:
	    ```shell
		# contents of example.sh
        #####
        ##!/bin/bash
		#ping -c 1 $1
		#if test "$?" -eq "0"; then
		#	echo "$1 IP is reachable"
		#else
		#	echo "$1 IP is not reachable"
		#fi
		#exit
        #####
        ```

	* Input arguments can be passed in after the script name, with e.g. 1 being the first input argument. The *$?* term expands the exit status of the most recently executed command. When using *echo* the *-e* argument can be used to print characters such as new lines.

	* An example using a case statement is shown with *example.sh* below:
	    ```shell
		# contents of example.sh
        #####
        ##!/bin/bash
		#now=$(date + "%a")
		#case $now in
		#	Mon)
		#		echo "Full Backup";
		#		;;
		#	Tue|Wed|Thu|Fri)
		#		echo "Partial Backup";
		#		;;
		#	Sat|Sun)
		#		echo "No Backup";
		#		;;
		#	*)	;;
		#esac
		#exit
        #####
        ```

	* An example using [] is shown with *example.sh* below:
	    ```shell
		# contents of example.sh
        #####
        ##!/bin/bash
		#ping -c 1 $1
		#if ["$?" -eq "0"]; then
		#	echo "$1 IP is reachable"
		#else
		#	echo "$1 IP is not reachable"
		#fi
		#exit
        #####
        ```

1. Use Looping constructs (for, etc.) to process file, command line input

	* An example of a for loop is shown with *example.sh* below:
	    ```shell
		# contents of example.sh
        #####
        ##!/bin/bash
		#for file in ./*.log
		#do
		#	mv "${file}" "${file}".txt
		#done
		#exit
        #####
        ```

	* An example of a while loop is shown with *example.sh* below:
	    ```shell
		# contents of example.sh
        #####
        ##!/bin/bash
		#input = "/home/kafka.log"
		#while IFS = read -r line
		#do
		#	echo "$line"
		#done < "$input"
		#exit
        #####
        ```

1. Process script inputs ($1, $2, etc.)

	* The first variable passed into a script can be accessed with *$1*.

1. Processing output of shell commands within a script

	* An example is shown with *example.sh* below:
	    ```shell
		# contents of example.sh
        #####
        ##!/bin/bash
		#echo "Hello World!" >> example-`date +%Y%m%d-%H%M`.log
		#exit
        #####
        ```

1. Processing shell command exit codes

	* The *$?* term expands the exit status of the most recently executed command.

### Operate running systems

1. Boot, reboot, and shut down a system normally

    * The RHEL boot process occurs when the system is powered up or reset and lasts until all enabled services are started and a login prompt appears at the screen. The login process consists of 4 steps:

        * The firmware is the Basic Input Output System (BIOS) or Unified Extensible Firmware Interface (UEFI) code that is stored in flash memory on the motherboard. The first thing it does is run the power-on-self-test (POST) to initialise the system hardware components. It also installs appropriate drivers for the video hardware and displays system messages to the screen. It scans the available storage devices to locate a boot device (GRUB2 on RHEL), and then loads it into memory and passes control to it.

        * The boot loader presents a menu with a list of bootable kernels available on the system. After a pre-defined amount of time it boots the default kernel. GRUB2 searches for the kernel in the `/boot` file system. It then extracts the kernel code into memory and loads it based on the configuration in `/boot/grub2/grub.cfg`. Note that for UEFI systems, GRUB2 looks in `/boot/efi` instead and loads based on configuration in `/boot/efi/EFI/redhat/grub.efi`. Once the kernel is loaded, GRUB2 passes control to it.

        * The kernel loads the initial RAM disk (initrd) image from the `/boot` file system. This acts as a temporary file system. The kernel then loads necessary modules from initrd to allow access to the physical disks and the partitions and file systems within. It also loads any drivers required to support the boot process. Later, the kernel unmounts initrd and mounts the actual root file system.

        * The kernel continues the boot process. *systemd* is the default system initialisation scheme. It starts all enabled user space system and network services.

    * The *shutdown* command is used to halt, power off, or reboot the system gracefully. This command broadcasts a warning message to all logged-in users, disables further user logins, waits for the specified time, and then stops the service and shuts to the system down to the specified target state. 
    
    * To shut down the system now:
        ```shell
        shutdown -P now
        ```

    * To halt the system now:
        ```shell
        shutdown -H now
        ```

    * To reboot the system now:
        ```shell
        shutdown -r now
        ```

    * To shut down the system after 5 minutes:
        ```shell
        shutdown -P 5
        ```

1. Boot systems into different targets manually

    * *systemd* is the default system initialisation mechanism in RHEL 8. It is the first process that starts at boot and it is the last process that terminates at shutdown.

    * *Units* are systemd objects that are used for organising boot and maintenance tasks, such as hardware initialisation, socket creation, file system mounts, and service start-ups. Unit configuration is stored in their respective configuration files, which are auto generated from other configurations, created dynamically from the system state, produced at runtime, or user developed. Units are in one of several operational states, including active, inactive, in the process of being activated or deactivated, and failed. Units can be enabled or disabled.

    * Units have a name and a type, which are encoded in files of the form unitname.type. Units can be viewed using the *systemctl* command. A target is a logical collection of units. They are a special systemd unit type with the .target file extension.

    * *systemctl* is the primary command for interaction with systemd. 

    * To boot into a custom target the *e* key can be pressed at the GRUB2 menu, and the desired target specified using systemd.unit. After editing press *ctrl+x* to boot into the target state. To boot into the emergency target: 
        ```shell
        systemd.unit=emergency.target
        ```

    * To boot into the rescue target:
        ```shell
        systemd.unit=rescue.target
        ```

    * Run *systemctl reboot* after you are done to reboot the system.

1. Interrupt the boot process in order to gain access to a system

    * Press *e* at the GRUB2 menu and add "rd.break" in place of "ro crash". This boot option tells the boot sequence to stop while the system is still using initramfs so that we can access the emergency shell.
    
    * Press *ctrl+x* to reboot.
    
    * Run the following command to remount the `/sysroot` directory with rw privileges:
        ```shell
        mount -o remount,rw /sysroot
        ```
    *  Run the following command to change the root directory to `/sysroot`:
        ```shell
        chroot /sysroot
        ```
    *  Run *passwd* command to change the root password.
    
    *  Run the following commands to create an empty, hidden file to instruct the system to perform SELinux relabelling after the next boot:
        ```shell
        touch /.autorelabel
        exit
        exit
        ```

1. Identify CPU/memory intensive processes and kill processes

    * A process is a unit for provisioning system resources. A process is created in memory in its own address space when a program, application, or command is initiated. Processes are organised in a hierarchical fashion. Each process has a parent process that spawns it and may have one or many child processes. Each process is assigned a unique identification number, known as the Process Identifier (PID). When a process completes its lifecycle or is terminated, this event is reported back to its parent process, and all the resources provisioned to it are then freed and the PID is removed. Processes spawned at system boot are called daemons. Many of these sit in memory and wait for an event to trigger a request to use their services.

    * There are 5 basic process states:
        * Running: The process is being executed by the CPU.
        
        * Sleeping: The process is waiting for input from a user or another process.
        
        * Waiting: The process has received the input it was waiting for and is now ready to run when its turn arrives.
        
        * Stopped: The process is halted and will not run even when its turn arrives, unless a signal is sent to change its behaviour.
        
        * Zombie: The process is dead. Its entry is retained until the parent process permits it to die.

    * The *ps* and *top* commands can be used to view running processes.
    
    * The *pidof* or *pgrep* commands can be used to view the PID associated with a process name.
    
    * The *ps* command can be used to view the processes associated with a particular user. An example is shown below:
        ```shell
        ps -U root
        ```

    * To kill a process the *kill* or *pkill* commands can be used. Ordinary users can kill processes they own, while the *root* user can kill any process. The *kill* command requires a PID and the *pkill* command requires a process name. An example is shown below:
        ```shell
        pkill crond
        kill `pidof crond`
        ```

    * The list of signals accessible by *kill* can be seen by passing the *-l* option. The default signal is SIGTERM which signals for a process to terminate in an orderly fashion.

    * To use the SIGKILL signal:
        ```shell
        pkill -9 crond
        kill -9 `pgrep crond`
        ```

    * The *killall* command can be used to terminate all processes that match a specified criterion.
    
1. Adjust process scheduling

    * The priority of a process ranges from -20 (highest) to +19 (lowest). A higher niceness lowers the execution priority of a process and a lower niceness increases it. A child process inherits the niceness of its parent process.

    * To run a command with a lower (+2) priority:
        ```shell
        nice -2 top
        ```

    * To run a command with a higher (-2) priority:
        ```shell
        nice --2 top
        ```

    * To renice a running process:
        ```shell
        renice 5 1919
        ```
    
1. Manage tuning profiles

    * Tuned is a service which monitors the system and optimises the performance of the system for different use cases. There are pre-defined tuned profiles available in the `/usr/lib/tuned` directory. New profiles are created in the `/etc/tuned` directory. The *tuned-adm* command allows you to interact with the Tuned service.

    * To install and start the tuned service:
        ```shell
        yum install tuned
        systemctl enable --now tuned
        ```
 
    * To check the currently active profile:
        ```shell
        tuned-adm active
        ```

    * To check the recommended profile:
        ```shell
        tuned-adm recommend
        ```

    * To change the active profile:
        ```shell
        tuned-adm profile <profile-name>
        ```

    * To create a customised profile and set it as active:
        ```shell   
        mkdir /etc/tuned/<profile-name>
        vi /etc/tuned/<profile-name>/<profile-name.conf>
        # customise as required
        tuned-adm profile <profile-name>
        systmctl restart tuned.service
        ```

1. Locate and interpret system log files and journals

    * In RHEL logs capture messages generated by the kernel, daemons, commands, user activities, applications, and other events. The daemon that is responsible for system logging is called *rsyslogd*. The configuration file for *rsyslogd* is in the `/etc/rsyslog.conf` file. As defined in this configuration file, the default repository for most logs is the `/var/log` directory.

    * The below commands can be used to start and stop the daemon:
        ```shell   
        systemctl stop rsyslog
        systemctl start rsyslog
        ```
    * A script called *logrotate* in `/etc/cron.daily` invokes the *logrotate* command to rotate log files as per the configuration file.

    * The boot log file is available at `/var/log/boot.log` and contains logs generated during system start-up. The system log file is available in `/var/log/messages` and is the default location for storing most system activities.

1. Preserve system journals

    * In addition to system logging, the *journald* daemon (which is an element of *systemd*) also collects and manages log messages from the kernel and daemon processes. It also captures system logs and RAM disk messages, and any alerts generated during the early boot stage. It stores these messages in binary format in files called *journals* in the `/var/run/journal` directory. These files are structured and indexed for faster and easier searches and can be viewed and managed using the *journalctl* command.

    * By default, journals are stored temporarily in the `/run/log/journal` directory. This is a memory-based virtual file system and does not persist across reboots. To have journal files stored persistently in `/var/log/journal` the following commands can be run:
        ```shell   
        mkdir -p /var/log/journal
        systemctl restart systemd-journald
        ```

1. Start, stop, and check the status of network services

    * The *sshd* daemon manages ssh connections to the server. To check the status of this service:
        ```shell   
        systemctl is-active sshd        
        systemctl status sshd
        ```

    * To start and stop this service:
        ```shell   
        systemctl start sshd
        systemctl stop sshd
        ```

    * To enable or disable this service:
        ```shell      
        systemctl enable sshd
        systemctl disable sshd
        ```

    * To completely disable the service (i.e. to avoid loading the service at all):
        ```shell   
        systemctl mask sshd
        systemctl unmask sshd
        ```

1. Securely transfer files between systems

    * To transfer a file using the Secure Copy Protocol (SCP):
        ```shell   
        scp <file> <user>@<ip>:<file>
        ```

    * To transfer a directory:
        ```shell   
        scp /etc/ssh/* <user>@<ip>:/tmp
        ```

    * The direction of transfer can also be reversed:
        ```shell   
        scp <user>@<ip>:/tmp/sshd_config sshd_config_external
        ```

### Configure local storage

1. List, create, delete partitions on MBR and GPT disks

    * Data is stored on disk drives that are logically divided into partitions. A partition can exist on a portion of a disk, an entire disk, or across multiple disks. Each partition can contain a file system, raw data space, swap space, or dump space.

    * A disk in RHEL can be divided into several partitions. This partition information is stored on the disk in a small region, which is read by the operating system at boot time. This is known as the Master Boot Record (MBR) on BIOS-based systems, and GUID Partition Table (GPT) on UEFI-based systems. At system boot, the BIOS/UEFI scans all storage devices, detects the presence of MBR/GPT, identifies the boot disks, loads the boot loader program in memory from the default boot disk, executes the boot code to read the partition table and identify the `/boot` partition, and continues with the boot process by loading the kernel in the memory and passing control over to it.

    * MBR allows the creation of only up to 4 primary partitions on a single disk, with the option of using one of the 4 partitions as an extended partition to hold an arbitrary number of logical partitions. MBR also lacks addressing space beyond 2TB due to its 32-bit nature and the disk sector size of 512-byte that it uses. MBR is also non-redundant, so a system becomes unbootable if it becomes corrupted somehow.

    * GPT is a newer 64-bit partitioning standard developed and integrated to UEFI firmware. GPT allows for 128 partitions, use of disks much larger than 2TB, and redundant locations for the storage of partition information. GPT also allows a BIOS-based system to boot from a GPT disk, using the boot loader program stored in a protective MBR at the first disk sector.

    * To list the mount points, size, and available space:
        ```shell   
        df -h
        ```

    * In RHEL block devices are an abstraction for certain hardware, such hard disks. The *blkid* command lists all block devices. The *lsblk* command lists more details about block devices.

    * To list all disks and partitions:
        ```shell   
        fdisk -l # MBR
        gdisk -l # GPT
        ```

    * For MBR based partitions the *fdisk* utility can be used to create and delete partitions. To make a change to a disk:
        ```shell   
        fdisk <disk>
        ```

    * For GPT based partitions the *gdisk* utility can be used to create and delete partitions. To make a change to a disk:
        ```shell   
        gdisk <disk>
        ```

    * To inform the OS of partition table changes:
        ```shell   
        partprobe
        ```
    
1. Create and remove physical volumes

    * Logical Volume Manager (LVM) is used to provide an abstraction layer between the physical storage and the file system. This enables the file system to be resized, to span across multiple physical disks, use random disk space, etc. One or more partitions or disks (physical volumes) can form a logical container (volume group), which is then divided into logical partitions (called logical volumes). These are further divided into physical extents (PEs) and logical extents (LEs).

    * A physical volume (PV) is created when a block storage device is brought under LVM control after going through the initialisation process. This process constructs LVM data structures on the device, including a label on the second sector and metadata information. The label includes a UUID, device size, and pointers to the locations of data and metadata areas.

    * A volume group (VG) is created when at least one physical volume is added to it. The space from all physical volumes in a volume group is aggregated to form one large pool of storage, which is then used to build one or more logical volumes. LVM writes metadata information for the volume group on each physical volume that is added to it.

    * To view physical volumes:
        ```shell   
        pvs
        ```

    * To view physical volumes with additional details:
        ```shell   
        pvdisplay
        ```

    * To initialise a disk or partition for use by LVM:
        ```shell   
        pvcreate <disk>
        ```

    * To remove a physical volume from a disk:
        ```shell   
        pvremove <disk>
        ```

1. Assign physical volumes to volume groups

    * To view volume groups:
        ```shell   
        vgs
        ```

    * To view volume groups with additional details:
        ```shell   
        vgdisplay
        ```

    * To create a volume group:
        ```shell   
        vgcreate <name> <disk>
        ```

    * To extend an existing volume group:
        ```shell   
        vgextend <name> <disk>
        ```

    * To remove a disk from a volume group:
        ```shell   
        vgreduce <name> <disk>
        ```

    * To remove the last disk from a volume group:
        ```shell   
        vgremove <name> <disk>
        ```

1. Create and delete logical volumes

    * To view logical volumes:
        ```shell   
        lvs
        ```

    * To view logical volumes with additional details:
        ```shell   
        lvdisplay
        ```

    * To create a logical volume in vg1 named lv1 and with 4GB of space:
        ```shell   
        lvcreate -L 4G -n lv1 vg1 
        ```

    * To extend the logical volume by 1GB:
        ```shell   
        lvextend -L+1G <lvpath>
        ```

    * To extend the logical volume by 1GB:
        ```shell   
        lvextend -L+1G <lvpath>
        ```

    * To reduce the size for a logical volume by 1GB:
        ```shell   
        lvreduce -L-1G <lvpath>
        ```

    * To remove a logical volume:
        ```shell   
        umount <mountpoint>
        lvremove <lvpath>
        ```

1. Configure systems to mount file systems at boot by Universally Unique ID (UUID) or label
    
    * The `/etc/fstab` file is a system configuration file that lists all available disks, disk partitions and their options. Each file system is described on a separate line. The `/etc/fstab` file is used by the *mount* command, which reads the file to determine which options should be used when mounting the specific device. A file system can be added to this file so that it is mounted on boot automatically.
    
    * The *e2label* command can be used to change the label on ext file systems. This can then be used instead of the UUID.
    
1. Add new partitions and logical volumes, and swap to a system non-destructively

    * Virtual memory is equal to RAM plus swap space. A swap partition is a standard disk partition that is designated as swap space by the *mkswap* command. A file can also be used as swap space but that is not recommended.

    * To create a swap:
        ```shell   
        mkswap <device>
        ```

    * To enable a swap:
        ```shell   
        swapon <device>
        ```

    * To check the status of swaps:
        ```shell   
        swapon -s
        ```

    * To disable a swap:
        ```shell   
        swapoff <device>
        ```

    * The `/etc/fstab` file will need a new entry for the swap so that it is created persistently.

### Create and configure file systems

1. Create, mount, unmount, and use vfat, ext4, and xfs file systems

    * A file system is a logical container that is used to store files and directories. Each file system must be connected to the root of the directory hierarchy to be accessible. This is typically done automatically on system boot but can be done manually as well. Each file system can be mounted or unmounted using the UUID associated with it or by using a label that can be assigned to it. Mounting is the process of attaching an additional filesystem, which resides on a CDROM, Hard Disk Drive (HDD) or other storage device, to the currently accessible filesystem of a computer. 

    * Each file system is created in a separate partition or logical volume. A typical RHEL system has numerous file systems. During OS installation, the `/` and `/boot` file systems are created by default. Typical additional file systems created during installation include `/home`, `/opt`, `/tmp`, `/usr` and `/var`.

    * File systems supported in RHEL are categorised as disk-based, network-based, and memory-based. Disk-based and network-based file systems are stored persistently, while data in memory-based systems is lost at system reboot. The different file systems are shown below:

    | File System          | Type    | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
    |----------------------|---------|-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
    | ext2                 | Disk    | The second generation of the extended file system. The first generation is no longer supported. ext2 is deprecated in RHEL and will be removed in a future RHEL release.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
    | ext3                 | Disk    | The third generation of the extended file system. It supports metadata journaling for faster recovery, superior reliability, file systems up to 16TB, files up to 2TB, and up to 32,000 sub-directories. ext3 writes each metadata update in its entirety to the journal after it has been completed. The system looks in the file system journal following a reboot after a system crash has occurred, and recovers the file system rapidly using the updated structural information stored in its journal. |
    | ext4                 | Disk    | The fourth generation of the extended file system. It supports file systems up to 1EB, files up to 16TB, an unlimited number of sub-directories, metadata and quota journaling, and extended user attributes.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
    | xfs                  | Disk    | XFS is a highly scalable and high-performance 64-bit file system.  It supports metadata journaling for faster crash recovery, online defragmentation, expansion quota journaling, and extended user attributes. It supports file systems and files of sizes up to 8EB. It is the default file system in RHEL 8.                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
    | btrfs                | Disk    | B-tree file system that supports a system size of 50TB.

    | CIFS                 | Network | Common Internet File System (aka Samba). A directory or file system shared over the network for access by Windows and other Linux systems.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

    * The *mount* command is used to attach a file system to a desired point in the directory hierarchy to make it accessible to users and applications. This point is referred to as the *mount point*, which is essentially an empty directory created solely for this point. The *mount* command requires the absolute pathname (or its UUID or label) to the block device containing the file system, and a mount point name to attach it to the directory tree. The *mount* command adds an entry to the `/proc/mounts` file and instructs the kernel to add the entry to the `/proc/mounts` file as well after a file system has been successfully mounted.

    * The opposite of the *mount* command is *unmount*, which is used to detach a file system from the directory hierarchy and make it inaccessible to users and applications.

    * To create a vfat file system:
        ```shell   
        mkfs.vfat <path>
        ```

    * To mount a vfat file system:
        ```shell   
        mount <path> /mnt
        ```

     * To unmount a vfat file system:
        ```shell   
        umount <path> /mnt
        ```

     * To check a vfat file system:
        ```shell   
        fsck.vfat <path>
        ```

    * To create an ext4 file system:
        ```shell   
        mkfs.ext4 <path>
        ```

    * To mount an ext4 file system:
        ```shell   
        mount <path> /mnt
        ```

     * To unmount an ext4 file system:
        ```shell   
        umount <path> /mnt
        ```

        dumpe2fs <path>
        ```

    * To create a xfs file system:
        ```shell   
        mkfs.xfs <path>
        ```

    * To mount a xfs file system:
        ```shell   
        mount <path> /mnt
        ```

     * To unmount a xfs file system:
        ```shell   
        umount <path> /mnt
        ```

     * To check a xfs file system:
        ```shell   
        xfs_repair <path>
        ```

     * To get additional details about an xfs file system:
        ```shell   
        xfs_info <path>
        ```

    * The path is the device name or a regular file that shall contain the file system.

1. Mount and unmount network file systems using NFS

     * To confirm nfs-utils is installed:
        ```shell   
        dnf install nfs-utils
        ```

     * To mount the network file system:
        ```shell   
        mount -t nfs 10.0.2.5:/home/nfs-share /mnt
        ```

     * Alternatively the following can be run after adding the entry to `/etc/fstab`:
        ```shell   
        mount -a 
        ```

     * Using AutoFS with NFS:
        ```shell
		# on the server
        systemctl status 
		mkdir /common
		echo "/common *(rw)" >> /etc/exports
		systemctl restart nfs-server.service

		# on the client
		dnf install autofs -y
		mkdir /autodir
		vi /etc/auto.master
		# add line
		#/- /etc/auto.master.d/auto.dir
		vi /etc/auto.master.d/auto.dir
		# add line
		#/autodir 172.25.1.4:/common
		systemctl restart autofs & systemctl enable autofs

		# on the server
		touch /common/test
		
		# on the client
		ls /autodir # confirm test file is created
        ``` 

1. Extend existing logical volumes

     * To extend the logical volume size by 2GB:
        ```shell   
        lvextend -L+2G /dev/vg1/lv1
        lvdisplay # confirm changes
        ```

     * To extend the file system:
        ```shell   
        df -Th # confirm file system type
        resize2fs /dev/vg1/lvl1 # for ext3 or ext4
        xfs_growfs /mnt # for xfs
        ```

1. Create and configure set-GID directories for collaboration

     * SUID (meaning set user id) is used to specify that a user can run an executable file with effective permissions of the file owner.  This is primarily used to elevate the privileges of the current user. When a user executes the file, the operating system will execute as the file owner. Instead of the normal *x* which represents execute permissions, an *s* will be visible. To set the SUID:
        ```shell
        chmod u+s <filename>
        ```
     
     * SGID (meaning set group id) is used to specify that a user can run an executable file with effective permissions of the owning group.  When a user executes the file, the operating system will execute as the owning group. Instead of the normal x which represents execute permissions, an s will be visible. To set the SGID:
        ```shell
        chmod g+s <filename>
        ```
    
     * To create a group and shared directory:
        ```shell
        groupadd accounts
        mkdir -p /home/shared/accounts
        chown nobody:accounts /home/shared/accounts
        chmod g+s /home/shared/accounts
        chmod 070 /home/shared/accounts
        ```

     * When using SGID on a directory all files that are created in the directory will be owned by the group of the directory as opposed to the group of the owner.

     * If the sticky bit is set on a directory, the files in that directory can only be removed by the owner. A typical use case is for the `/tmp` directory. It can be written to by any user, but other users cannot delete the files of others. To set the sticky bit:
        ```shell
        chmod +t <directory>
        ```

    * The SUID, SGID and sticky bit can also be set with number notation. The standard number (rwx) is prepended with 4 for SUID, 2 for SGID, and 1 for the sticky bit.

    * To remove special permissions the *-* flag is used instead of the *+* flag.
     
1. Configure disk compression

    * The Virtual Data Optimiser (VDO) provides data reduction in the form of deduplication, compression, and thin provisioning.

    * To install vdo:
        ```shell
        dnf install vdo kmod-kvdo
        ```

    * To create the vdo:
        ```shell
        vdo create --name=vdo1 --device=/dev/sdb --vdoLogicalSize=30G --writePolicy=async
        ```

    * To create and mount the file system:
        ```shell
        mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/vdo1
        mount /dev/mapper/vdo1 /mnt
        ```

1. Manage layered storage

    * Stratis is a storage management solution introduced in RHEL 8 that allows the configuration of advanced storage features such as pool-based management, thin provisioning, file system snapshots and monitoring.

    * To install stratis:
        ```shell
        dnf install stratisd stratis-cli
        systemctl start stratisd
        ```

    * To confirm there is no file system on the disk to be used:
        ```shell
        lsblk
        blkid -p /dev/sdb
        ```

    * If there is a file system remove it using:
        ```shell
        wipefs -a /dev/sdb
        ```

    * To create a stratis pool and confirm:
        ```shell
        stratis pool create strat1 /dev/sdb
        stratis pool list
        ```

    * To create a file system and confirm:
        ```shell
        stratis fs create strat1 fs1
        stratis fs list
        ```

    * To mount the file system and confirm:
        ```shell
        mount /stratis/strat1/fs1 /mnt
        df -h
        # add to /etc/fstab to make it persistent
        ```

    * To add a disk to the stratis pool and confirm:
        ```shell
        stratis pool add-data strat1 /dev/sdc
        stratis pool list
        ```

    * To create a snapshot and confirm:
        ```shell
        stratis fs snapshot strat1 fs1 snapshot1
        stratis filesystem list strat1
        ```

    * To mount a snapshot:
        ```shell
        unmount /stratis/strat1/fs1
        mount /stratis/strat1/snapshot1 /mnt
        ```

    * To destroy a snapshot and confirm:
        ```shell
        unmount /stratis/strat1/snapshot1
        stratis filesystem destroy strat1 snapshot1
        stratis filesystem list
        ```

    * To remove a stratis filesystem and pool and confirm:
        ```shell
        stratis filesystem destroy strat1 fs1
        stratis filesystem list
        stratis pool destroy strat1
        stratis pool list
        ```

1. Diagnose and correct file permission problems

    * File permissions can be modified using *chmod* and *setfacl*.
    
### Deploy, configure, and maintain systems

1. Schedule tasks using at and cron

    * Job scheduling and execution is handled by the *atd* and *crond* daemons. While *atd* manages jobs scheduled to run once in the future, *crond* is responsible for running jobs repetitively at pre-specified times. At start-up, *crond* reads schedules in files located in the `/var/spool/cron` and `/etc/cron.d` directories, and loads them in memory for later execution.

    * There are 4 files that control permissions for setting scheduled jobs. These are *at.allow*, *at.deny*, *cron.allow* and *cron.deny*. These files are in the `/etc` directory. The syntax of the files is identical, with each file taking 1 username per line. If no files exist, then no users are permitted. By default, the *deny* files exist and are empty, and the *allow* files do not exist. This opens up full access to using both tools for all users.

    * All activities involving *atd* and *crond* are logged to the `/var/log/cron` file.

    * The *at* command is used to schedule one-time execution of a program by the *atd* daemon. All submitted jobs are stored in the `/var/spool/at` directory.

    * To schedule a job using *at* the below syntax is used:
        ```shell
        at 11:30pm 6/30/15
        ```

    * The commands to execute are defined in the terminal, press *ctrl+d* when finished. The added job can be viewed with *at* and can be removed with the *-d* option.

    * A shell script can also be provided:
        ```shell
        at -f ~/script1.sh 11:30pm 6/30/15
        ```

    * The `/etc/crontab` file has the following columns:
        * 1: Minutes of hour (0-59), with multiple comma separated values, or * to represent every minute.
        * 2: Hours of day (0-23), with multiple comma separated values, or * to represent every hour.
        * 3: Days of month (1-31), with multiple comma separated values, or * to represent every day.
        * 4: Month of year (1-12, jan-dec), with multiple comma separated values, or * to represent every month.
        * 5: Day of week (0-6, sun-sat), with multiple comma separated values, or * to represent every day.
        * 6: Full path name of the command or script to be executed, along with any arguments.
        
    * Step values can be used with */2 meaning every 2nd minute.
    
    * The *crontab* command can be used to edit the file. Common options are *e* (edit), *l* (view), *r* (remove):
        ```shell
        crontab -e
        ```

1. Start and stop services and configure services to start automatically at boot

    * To check the status of a service:
        ```shell
        systemctl status <service>
        ```

    * To start a service:
        ```shell
        systemctl start <service>
        ```

    * To stop a service:
        ```shell
        systemctl stop <service>
        ```

    * To make a service reload its configuration:
        ```shell
        systemctl reload <service>
        ```

    * To make a service reload its configuration or restart if it can't reload:
        ```shell
        systemctl reload-or-restart <service>
        ```

    * To make a service start on boot:
        ```shell
        systemctl enable <service>
        ```

    * To stop a service starting on boot:
        ```shell
        systemctl disable <service>
        ```

    * To check if a service is enabled:
        ```shell
        systemctl is-enabled <service>
        ```

    * To check if a service has failed:
        ```shell
        systemctl is-failed <service>
        ```

    * To view the configuration file for a service:
        ```shell
        systemctl cat /usr/lib/sysdtemd/system/<service>
        ```

   * To view the dependencies for a service:
        ```shell
        systemctl list-dependencies <service>
        ```

   * To stop a service from being run by anyone but the system and from being started on boot:
        ```shell
        systemctl mask <service>
        ```

   * To remove a mask:
        ```shell
        systemctl unmask <service>
        ```

1. Configure systems to boot into a specific target automatically

   * To get the default target:
        ```shell
        systemctl get-default
        ```

   * To list available targets:
        ```shell
        systemctl list-units --type target --all
        ```

   * To change the default target:
        ```shell
        systemctl set-default <target>
        ```

    * The change will take affect after a reboot.

1. Configure time service clients

    * To print the date:
        ```shell
        date +%d%m%y-%H%M%S
        ```

    * To set the system clock as per the hardware clock:
        ```shell
        hwclock -s
        ```

    * To set the hardware clock as per the system clock:
        ```shell
        hwclock -w
        ```

    * The *timedatectl* command can also be used to view the date and time.

    * To change the date or time:
        ```shell
        timedatectl set-time 2020-03-18
        timedatectl set-time 22:43:00
        ```

    * To view a list of time zones:
        ```shell
        timedatectl list-timezones
        ```

    * To change the time zone:
        ```shell
        timedatectl set-timezone <timezone>
        ```

    * To enable NTP:
        ```shell
        timedatectl set-ntp yes
        ```

    * To start the *chronyd* service:
        ```shell
        systemctl start chronyd
        ```

1. Install and update software packages from Red Hat Network, a remote repository, or from the local file system

    * The .rpm extension is a format for files that are manipulated by the Redhat Package Manager (RPM) package management system. RHEL 8 provides tools for the installation and administration of RPM packages. A package is a group of files organised in a directory structure and metadata that makes up a software application.

    * An RPM package name follows the below format:
        ```shell
        openssl-1.0.1e-34.el7.x86_64.rpm
        # package name = openssl
        # package version = 1.0.1e
        # package release = 34
        # RHEL version = el7
        # processor architecture = x86_64
        # extension = .rpm
        ```

    * The *subscription-manager* command can be used to link a Red Hat subscription to a system.

    * The *dnf* command is the front-end to *rpm* and is the preferred tool for package management. The *yum* command has been superseded by *dnf* in RHEL 8. It requires that the system has access to a software repository. The primary benefit of *dnf* is that it automatically resolves dependencies by downloading and installing any additional required packages.

    * To list enabled and disabled repositories:
        ```shell
        dnf repolist all
        dnf repoinfo
        ```
    
    * To search for a package:
        ```shell
        dnf search <package>
        dnf list <package>
        ```
    
    * To view more information about a particular package:
        ```shell
        dnf info <package>
        ```

    * To install a package:
        ```shell
        dnf install <package>
        ```

    * To remove a package:
        ```shell
        dnf remove <package>
        ```

    * To find a package from a file:
        ```shell
        dnf provides <path>
        ```

    * To install a package locally:
        ```shell
        dnf localinstall <path>
        ```

    * To view available groups:
        ```shell
        dnf groups list
        ```

    * To install a group (e.g. System Tools):
        ```shell
        dnf group "System Tools"
        ```

    * To remove a group (e.g. System Tools):
        ```shell
        dnf group remove "System Tools"
        ```

    * To see the history of installations using *dnf*:
        ```shell
        dnf history list
        ```

    * To undo a particular installation (e.g. ID=22):
        ```shell
        dnf history undo 22
        ```

    * To redo a particular installation (e.g. ID=22):
        ```shell
        dnf history redo 22
        ```

    * To add a repository using the dnf config manager:
        ```shell
        dnf config-manager --add-repo <url>
        ```

    * To enable a repository using the dnf config manager:
        ```shell
        dnf config-manager --enablerepo <repository>
        ```

    * To disable a repository using the dnf config manager:
        ```shell
        dnf config-manager --disablerepo <repository>
        ```

    * To create a repository:
        ```shell
        dnf install createrepo
        mkdir <path>
        createrepo --<name> <path>
        yum-config-manager --add-repo file://<path>
        ```

1. Work with package module streams

    * RHEL 8 introduced the concept of Application Streams. Components made available as Application Streams can be packaged as modules or RPM packages and are delivered through the AppStream repository in RHEL 8. Module streams represent versions of the Application Stream components. Only one module stream can be active at a particular time, but it allows multiple different versions to be available in the same dnf repository.
    
    * To view modules:
        ```shell
        dnf module list
        ```

    * To get information about a module: 
        ```shell
        dnf module info --profile <module-name>
        ```

    * To install a module: 
        ```shell
        dnf module install <module-name>
        ```

    * To remove a module: 
        ```shell
        dnf module remove <module-name>
        ```

    * To reset a module after removing it: 
        ```shell
        dnf module reset <module-name>
        ```

    * To be specific about the module installation:
        ```shell
        dnf module install <module-name>:<version>/<profile>
        ```

    * To check the version of a module:
        ```shell
        <module-name> -v
        ```

1. Modify the system bootloader

    * The GRUB2 configuration can be edited directly on the boot screen. The configuration can also be edited using the command line.

    * To view the grub2 commands: 
        ```shell
        grub2
        ```

    * To make a change to the configuration: 
        ```shell
        vi /etc/default/grub
        # Change a value
        grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
        # View changes
        vi /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
        ```

### Manage basic networking

1. Configure IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

    * The format of an IPv4 address is a set of 4 8-bit integers that gives a 32-bit IP address.  The format of an IPv6 is a set of 8 16-bit hexadecimal numbers that gives a 128-bit IP address.

    * The *nmcli* command is used to configure networking using the NetworkManager service. This command is used to create, display, edit, delete, activate, and deactivate network connections. Each network device corresponds to a Network Manager device.

    * Using nmcli with the connection option lists the available connection profiles in NetworkManager.

    * The *ip* command can also be used for network configuration. The main difference between ip and nmcli is that changes made with the ip command are not persistent.
    
    * To view system IP addresses:
        ```shell
        ip addr
        ```

    * To show the current connections:
        ```shell
        nmcli connection show
        ```

    * Using nmcli with the device option lists the available network devices in the system.

    * To view the current network device status and details:
        ```shell
        nmcli device status
        nmcli device show
        ```

    * To add an ethernet IPv4 connection:
        ```shell
        nmcli connection add con-name <name> ifname <name> type ethernet ip4 <address> gw4 <address>
        ```

    * To manually modify a connection:
        ```shell
        nmcli connection modify <name> ipv4.addresses <address>
        nmcli connection modify <name> ipv4.method manual
        ```

    * To delete a connection:
        ```shell
        nmcli connection delete <name>
        ```

    * To activate a connection:
        ```shell
        nmcli connection up <name>
        ```

    * To deactivate a connection:
        ```shell
        nmcli connection down <name>
        ```

    * To check the DNS servers that are being used:
        ```shell
        cat /etc/resolv.conf
        ```

    * To change the DNS server being used:
        ```shell
        nmcli con mod <name> ipv4.dns <dns>
        systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
        ```
   
1. Configure hostname resolution

    * To lookup the IP address based on a host name the *host* or *nslookup* commands can be used.

    * The `/etc/hosts` file is like a local DNS. The `/etc/nsswitch.conf` file controls the order that resources are checked for resolution. 

    * To lookup the hostname:
        ```shell
        hostname -s # short
        hostname -f # fully qualified domain name
        ```

    * The hostname file is in `/etc/hostname`. To refresh any changes run the *hostnamectl* command.

1. Configure network services to start automatically at boot

    * To install a service and make it start automatically at boot:
        ```shell
        dnf install httpd
        systemctl enable httpd
        ```
    
    * To set a connection to be enabled on boot:
        ```shell
        nmcli connection modify eth0 connection.autoconnect yes
        ```

1. Restrict network access using firewall-cmd/firewall

	* Netfilter is a framework provided by the Linux kernel that provides functions for packet filtering. In RHEL 7 and earlier iptables was the default way of configuring Netfilter. Disadvantages of ipables were that a separate version (ip6tables) was required for ipv6, and that the user interface is not very user friendly.

    * The default firewall system in RHEL 8 is *firewalld*. Firewalld is a zone-based firewall. Each zone can be associated with one or more network interfaces, and each zone can be configured to accept or deny services and ports. The *firewall-cmd* command is the command line client for firewalld.

    * To check firewall zones:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --get-zones
        ```

    * To list configuration for a zone:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --zone work --list-all
        ```

    * To create a new zone:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --new-zone servers --permanent
        ```

    * To reload firewall-cmd configuration:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --reload
        ```

    * To add a service to a zone:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --zone servers --add-service=ssh --permanent
        ```

    * To add an interface to a zone:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --change-interface=enp0s8 --zone=servers --permanent
        ```

    * To get active zones:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --get-active-zones
        ```

    * To set a default zone:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --set-default-zone=servers
        ```

    * To check the services allowed for a zone:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --get-services
        ```

    * To add a port to a zone:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --add-port 8080/tcp --permanent --zone servers
        ```

    * To remove a service from a zone:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --remove-service https --permanent --zone servers
        ```

    * To remove a port from a zone:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --remove-port 8080/tcp --permanent --zone servers
        ```

### Manage users and groups

1. Create, delete, and modify local user accounts

    * RHEL 8 supports three user account types: root, normal and service. The root user has full access to all services and administrative functions. A normal user can run applications and programs that they are authorised to execute. Service accounts are responsible for taking care of the installed services.

    * The `/etc/passwd` file contains vital user login data.

    * The `/etc/shadow` file is readable only by the root user and contains user authentication information. Each row in the file corresponds to one entry in the passwd file. The password expiry settings are defined in the `/etc/login.defs` file. The `/etc/defaults/useradd` file contains defaults for the *useradd* command.

    * The `/etc/group` file contains the group information. Each row in the file stores one group entry.

    * The `/etc/gshadow` file stores encrypted group passwords. Each row in the file corresponds to one entry in the group file.

    * Due to manual modification, inconsistencies may arise between the above four authentication files. The *pwck* command is used to check for inconsistencies.

    * The *vipw* and *vigr* commands are used to modify the *passwd* and *group* files, respectively. These commands disable write access to these files while the privileged user is making the modifications.

    * To create a user:
        ```shell
        useradd user1
        ```
    
    * To check that the user has been created:
        ```shell
        cat /etc/group | grep user1
        ```

    * To specify the UID and GID at user creation:
        ```shell
        useradd -u 1010 -g 1005 user1
        ```

    * To create a user and add them to a group:
        ```shell
        useradd -G IT user2
        ```

	* Note that *-G* is a secondary group, and *-g* is the primary group. The primary group is the group that the operating system assigns to files to which a user belongs. A secondary group is one or more other groups to which a user also belongs. 

    * To delete a user:
        ```shell
        userdel user1
        ```

    * To modify a user:
        ```shell 
        usermod -l user5 user1 # note that home directory will remain as user1
        ```

    * To add a user but not give access to the shell:
        ```shell 
        useradd -s /sbin/nologin user
        ```

1. Change passwords and adjust password aging for local user accounts

    * To change the password for a user:
        ```shell 
        passwd user1
        ```

    * To step through password aging information the *chage* command can be used without any options.

    * To view user password expiry information:
        ```shell 
        chage -l user1
        ```

    * To set the password expiry for a user 30 days from now:
        ```shell 
        chage -M 30 user1
        ```

    * To set the password expiry date:
        ```shell 
        chage -E 2021-01-01 user1
        ```

    * To set the password to never expire:
        ```shell 
        chage -E -1 user1
        ```

1. Create, delete, and modify local groups and group memberships

    * To create a group:
        ```shell 
        groupadd IT
        ```

    * To create a group with a specific GID:
        ```shell 
        groupadd -g 3032
        ```

    * To delete a group:
        ```shell 
        groupdel IT
        ```

    * To modify the name of a group:
        ```shell 
        groupmod -n IT-Support IT
        ```

    * To modify the GID of a group:
        ```shell 
        groupmod -g 3033 IT-Support
        ```

    * To add a user to a group:
        ```shell 
        groupmod -aG IT-Support user1
        ```

    * To view the members of a group:
        ```shell 
        groupmems -l -g IT-Support
        ```

    * To remove a user from a group:
        ```shell 
        gpasswd -d user1 IT-Support
        ```

1. Configure superuser access

    * To view the sudoers file:
        ```shell 
        visudo /etc/sudoers
        ```

    * Members of the wheel group can use sudo on all commands. To add a user to the wheel group:
        ```shell 
        sudo usermod -aG wheel user1
        ```

    * To allow an individual user sudo access to specific commands:
        ```shell
        visudo /etc/sudoers
        user2 ALL=(root) /bin/ls, /bin/df -h, /bin/date
        ```

### Manage security

1. Configure firewall settings using firewall-cmd/firewalld

    * Network settings such as masquerading and IP forwarding can also be configured in the firewall-config GUI application. To install this application:
        ```shell
        dnf install firewall-config
        ```

    * To set port forwarding in the kernel setting:
        ```shell
        vi /etc/sysctl.conf
        # add line
        net.ipv4.ip_forward=1
        # save file
        sysctl -p
        ```

1. Create and use file access control lists

    * To give a user read and write access to a file using an access control list:
        ```shell
        setfacl -m u:user1:rw- testFile
        getfacl testFile
        ```

    * To restrict a user from accessing a file using an access control list:
        ```shell
        setfacl -m u:user1:000 testFile
        getfacl testFile
        ```

    * To remove an access control list for a user:
        ```shell
        setfacl -x u:user1 testFile
        getfacl testFile
        ```

    * To give a group read and execute access to a directory recursively using an access control list:
        ```shell
        setfacl -R -m g:IT-Support:r-x testDirectory
        getfacl testFile
        ```

    * To remove an access control list for a group:
        ```shell
        setfacl -x g:IT-Support testDirectory
        getfacl testFile
        ```

1. Configure key-based authentication for SSH

    * To generate an id_rsa and id_rsa.pub files:
        ```shell
        ssh-keygen
        ```
    * To enable ssh for a user:
        ```shell
        touch authorized_keys
        echo "publicKey" > /home/new_user/.ssh/authorized_keys
        ```

    * To copy the public key from server1 to server2:
        ```shell
        ssh-copy-id -i ~/.ssh/id_rsa.pub server2
        cat ~/.ssh/known_hosts # validate from server1
        ```

1. Set enforcing and permissive modes for SELinux

    * Security Enhanced Linux (SELinux) is an implementation of Mandatory Access Control (MAC) architecture developed by the U.S National Security Agency (NSA). MAC provides an added layer of protection beyond the standard Linux Discretionary Access Control (DAC), which includes the traditional file and directory permissions, ACL settings, setuid/setgid bit settings, su/sudo privileges etc.

    * MAC controls are fine-grained; they protect other services in the event one of the services is negotiated. MAC uses a set of defined authorisation rules called policy to examine security attributes associated with subjects and objects when a subject tries to access an object and decides whether to permit this access attempt. SELinux decisions are stored in a special cache referred to as Access Vector Cache (AVC).

    * When an application or process makes a request to access an object, SELinux checks with the AVC, where permissions are cached for subjects and objects. If a decision is unable to be made, it sends the request to the security server. The security server checks for the security context of the app or process and the object. Security context is applied from the SELinux policy database. 

    * To check the SELinux status:
        ```shell
        getenforce
        sestatus
        ```

    * To put SELinux into permissive mode modify the `/etc/selinux/config` file as per the below and reboot:
        ```shell
        SELINUX=permissive
        ```

    * Messages logged from SELinux are available in `/var/log/messages`.

1. List and identify SELinux file and process context

    * To view the SELinux contexts for files:
        ```shell
        ls -Z
        ```

    * To view the contexts for a user:
        ```shell
        id -Z
        ```
    * The contexts shown follow the user:role:type:level syntax. The SELinux user is mapped to a Linux user using the SELinux policy. The role is an intermediary between domains and SELinux users. The type defines a domain for processes, and a type for files. The level is used for Multi-Category Security (MCS) and Multi-Level Security (MLS).

    * To view the processes for a user:
        ```shell
        ps -Z # ps -Zaux to see additional information
        ```

1. Restore default file contexts

    * To view the SELinux contexts for files:
        ```shell
        chcon unconfined:u:object_r:tmp_t:s0
        ```

    * To restore the SELinux contexts for a file:
        ```shell
        restorecon file.txt
        ```

    * To restore the SELinux contexts recursively for a directory:
        ```shell
        restorecon -R directory
        ```

1. Use Boolean settings to modify system SELinux settings

    * SELinux has many contexts and policies already defined. Booleans within SELinux allow common rules to be turned on and off.

    * To check a SELinux Boolean setting:  
        ```shell
        getsebool -a | grep virtualbox
        ```

    * To set a SELinux Boolean setting permanently:  
        ```shell
       setsebool -P use_virtualbox on
        ```

1. Diagnose and address routine SELinux policy violations

    * The SELinux Administration tool is a graphical tool that enables many configuration and management operations to be performed. To install and run the tool:
       ```shell
       yum install setools-gui
       yum install policycoreutils-gui
       system-config-selinux
       ```

    * SELinux alerts are written to `/var/log/audit/audit.log` if the *auditd* daemon is running, or to the `/var/log/messages` file via the *rsyslog* daemon in the absence of *auditd*.

    * A GUI called the SELinux Troubleshooter can be accessed using the *sealert* command. This allows SELinux denial messages to be analysed and provides recommendations on how to fix issues.

### Manage containers

1. Find and retrieve container images from a remote registry

	* A container is used for running multiple isolated applications on the same hardware. Unlike a virtual machine, containers share the host systems operating system. This is more lightweight but a little less flexible.

	* Podman is a container engine developed by Redhat. Podman is an alternative to the well-known container engine Docker. It is used to directly manage pods and container images. The Podman Command Line Interface (CLI) uses the same commands as the Docker CLI. Docker is not officially supported in RHEL 8.
	
	* To search for an image in a remote repository and download it:
        ```shell
        dnf install podman -y
        podman search httpd # note that docker.io/library/httpd has 3000+ stars
        podman pull docker.io/library/httpd
        ```

1. Inspect container images

	* To view images after they have been downloaded:
	    ```shell
        podman images
        ```

	* To inspect an image using Podman:
        ```shell
        podman inspect -l # -l gets the latest container
        ```

	* To inspect an image in a remote registry using Skopeo:
        ```shell
        dnf install skopeo -y
		skopeo inspect docker://registry.fedoraproject.org/fedora:latest
        ```

1. Perform container management using commands such as podman and skopeo

	* The man page for Podman and bash-completion can be used to provide more details on the usage of Podman.

	* To view the logs for a container:
        ```shell
        podman logs -l
        ```

	* To view the pids for a container:
        ```shell
        podman top -l
        ```

1. Perform basic container management such as running, starting, stopping, and listing running containers

	* To start, stop and remove a container:
        ```shell
		podman run -dt -p 8080:80/tcp docker.io/library/httpd # redirect requests on 8080 host port to 80 container port
	    podman ps -a # view container details, use -a to see all
	    # check using 127.0.0.1:8080 on a browser
	    podman stop af1fc4ca0253 # container ID from podman ps -a
	    podman rm af1fc4ca0253
        ```

1. Run a service inside a container

	* A Dockerfile can be used to create a custom container:
        ```shell
        sudo setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup on
		vi Dockerfile

	* Note that the SELinux Boolean referred to above can be found using:
	    ```shell
		getsebool -a | grep "container"
        ```

	* Note that the registry above is the Podman Universal Base Image (UBI) for RHEL 8.

1. Configure a container to start automatically as a systemd service

	* Podman was not originally designed to bring up an entire Linux system or manage services for such things as start-up order, dependency, checking, and failed service recovery. That is the job of an initialisation system like systemd.

	* By setting up a systemd unit file on your host computer, you can have the host automatically start, stop, check the status, and otherwise manage a container as a systemd service. Many Linux services are already packaged for RHEL to run as systemd services.

	* To configure a container to run as a systemd service:
        ```shell
		sudo setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup on
        podman run -d --name httpd-server -p 8080:80 # -d for detached, -p for port forwarding
		podman ps # confirm the container is running
		vi /etc/systemd/system/httpd-container.service
        # contents of httpd-container.service
        #####
        #[Unit]
        #Description=httpd Container Service
		#Wants=syslog.service
		#
		#[Service]
		#Restart=always
		#ExecStart=/usr/bin/podman start -a httpd-server
		#ExecStop=/usr/bin/podman stop -t 2 httpd-server
		#
		#[Install]
		#WantedBy=multi-user.target
        #####
		systemctl start httpd-container.service
		systemctl status httpd-container.service # confirm running
		systemctl enable httpd-container.service # will not run as part multi-user.target
        ```

	* Note that other systemd services can be viewed in `/etc/systemd/system` and used as examples.

1. Attach persistent storage to a container

	* To attach persistent storage to a container:
        ```shell
		ls /dev/sda1 # using this disk
		mkdir -p /home/containers/disk1
		podman run --privileged -it -v /home/containers/disk1:/mnt docker.io/library/httpd /bin/bash #  --privileged to allow with SELinux, -it for interactive terminal, -v to mount, and /bin/bash to provide a terminal
        ```

### Exercises

1. Recovery and Practise Tasks

    * Recover the system and fix repositories:
        ```shell
        # press e at grub menu
        rd.break # add to line starting with "linux16"
        # Replace line containing "BAD" with "x86_64"
        mount -o remount, rw /sysroot
        chroot /sysroot
        passwd
        touch /.autorelabel
        # reboot
        # reboot - will occur automaticaly after relabel (you can now login)
        grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg # fix grub config
        yum repolist all
        # change files in /etc/yum.repos.d to enable repository
        yum update -y
        # reboot
        ```

    * Add 3 new users alice, bob and charles. Create a marketing group and add these users to the group. Create a directory `/marketing` and change the owner to alice and group to marketing. Set permissions so that members of the marketing group can share documents in the directory but nobody else can see them. Give charles read-only permission. Create an empty file in the directory: 
        ```shell
        useradd alice
        useradd bob
        useradd charles
        groupadd marketing
        mkdir /marketing
        usermod -aG marketing alice
        usermod -aG marketing bob
        usermod -aG marketing charles
        chgrp marketing marketing # may require restart to take effect
        chmod 770 marketing
        setfacl -m u:charles:r marketing
        setfacl -m g:marketing:-wx marketing
        touch file
        ```

    * Set the system time zone and configure the system to use NTP:
        ```shell
        yum install chrony
        systemctl enable chronyd.service
        systemctl start chronyd.service
        timedatectl set-timezone Australia/Sydney
        timedatectl set-ntp true
        ```

    * Install and enable the GNOME desktop:
        ```shell
        yum grouplist
        yum groupinstall "GNOME Desktop" -y
        systemtctl set-default graphical.target
        reboot
        ```

    * Configure the system to be an NFS client:
        ```shell
        yum install nfs-utils
        ```

    * Configure password aging for charles so his password expires in 60 days:
        ```shell
        chage -M 60 charles
        chage -l charles # to confirm result
        ```

    * Lock bobs account:
        ```shell
        passwd -l bob
        passwd --status bob # to confirm result
        ```

    * Find all setuid files on the system and save the list to `/testresults/setuid.list`:
        ```shell
        find / -perm /4000 > setuid.list
        ```

    * Set the system FQDN to *centos.local* and alias to *centos*:
        ```shell
        hostnamectl set-hostname centos --pretty
        hostnamectl set-hostname centos.local
        hostname -s # to confirm result
        hostname # to confirm result
        ```

    * As charles, create a once-off job that creates a file called `/testresults/bob` containing the text "Hello World. This is Charles." in 2 days later:
        ```shell
        vi hello.sh
        # contents of hello.sh
        #####
        #!/bin/bash
        # echo "Hello World. This is Charles." > bob
        #####
        chmod 755 hello.sh
        usermod charles -U -e -- "" # for some reason the account was locked
        at now + 2 days -f /testresults/bob/hello.sh
        cd /var/spool/at # can check directory as root to confirm
        atq # check queued job as charles
        # atrm 1 # can remove the job using this command
        ```

    * As alice, create a periodic job that appends the current date to the file `/testresults/alice` every 5 minutes every Sunday and Wednesday between the hours of 3am and 4am. Remove the ability of bob to create cron jobs:
        ```shell
        echo "bob" >> /etc/at.deny
        sudo -i -u alice
        vi addDate.sh
        # contents of hello.sh
        #####
        ##!/bin/bash
        #date >> alice
        #####
        /testresults/alice/addDate.sh
        crontab -e
        # */5 03,04 * * sun,wed /testresults/alice/addDate.sh
        crontab -l # view crontab
        # crontab -r can remove the job using this command
        ```

    * Set the system SELinux mode to permissive:
        ```shell
        setstatus # confirm current mode is not permissive
        vi /etc/selinux/config # Update to permissive
        reboot
        setstatus # confirm current mode is permissive
        ```

    * Create a firewall rule to drop all traffic from 10.10.10.*:
        ```shell
        firewall-cmd --zone=drop --add-source 10.10.10.0/24
        firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=drop # confirm rule is added
        firewall-cmd --permanent --add-source 10.10.10.0/24
        reboot
        firewall-cmd --list-all --zone=drop # confirm rule remains
        ```

        ssh-keygen # created in /home/dev/.ssh
        ssh-copy-id 34.204.14.34
        ```    

    * Copy all tar files from `/home/dev/` on server1 to `/home/dev/` on server2, and extract them making sure the output is redirected to `/home/dev/tar-output.log`:
        ```shell
        scp *.tar* dev@34.204.14.34:/home/dev
        tar xfz deploy_script.tar.gz > tar-output.log
        tar xfz deploy_content.tar.gz >> tar-output.log
        ```
    
    * Set the umask so that new files are only readable and writeable by the owner:
        ```shell
        umask 0066 # default is 0666, subtract 0066 to get 0600
        ```

    * Verify the `/home/dev/deploy.sh` script is executable and run it:
        ```shell

    * Configure umask to ensure all files created by any user cannot be accessed by the "other" users:
        ```shell
		umask 0026 # also reflect change in /etc/profile and /etc/bashrc
		# default for files is 0666 so will be 0640 after mask
        ```

    * Find all files in `/etc` (not including subdirectories) that are older than 720 days, and output a list to `/root/oldfiles`:
        ```shell
		find /etc -maxdepth 1 -mtime +720 > /root/oldfiles 
        ```

    * Find all log messages in `/var/log/messages` that contain "ACPI", and export them to a file called `/root/logs`. Then archive all of `/var/log` and save it to `/tmp/log_archive.tgz`:
        ```shell
		grep "ACPI" /var/log/messages > /root/logs
		tar -czf /tmp/log_archive.tgz /var/log/ # note f flag must be last!
        ```

        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Exercise 16-1: Export Share on NFS Server

	* Create a directory called `/common` and export it to *server1* in read/write mode. Ensure that NFS traffic is allowed through the firewall. Confirm the export:
	    ```shell
		dnf install nfs-utils -y
		mkdir /common
		firewall-cmd --permanent --add-service=nfs
		firewall-cmd --reload
		systemctl start nfs-server.service & systemctl enable nfs-server.service
		echo "/nfs *(rw)" >> /etc/exports
		exportfs -av
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Exercise 16-2: Mount Share on NFS Client

	* Mount the `/common` share exported above. Create a mount point called `/local`, mount the remote share manually, and confirm the mount. Add the remote share to the file system table for persistence. Remount the share and confirm the mount. Create a test file in the mount point and confirm the file creation on the NFS server:
	    ```shell
		dnf install cifs-utils -y
		mkdir /local
		chmod 755 local
		mount 10.0.2.15:/common /local
		vi /etc/fstab
		# add line
		# 10.0.2.15:/common /local nfs _netdev 0 0
		mount -a
		touch /local/test # confirm that it appears on server in common
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Exercise 16-3: Access NFS Share Using Direct Map

	* Configure a direct map to automount the NFS share `/common` that is available from *server2*. Install the relevant software, create a local mount point `/autodir`, and set up AutoFS maps to support the automatic mounting. Note that `/common` is already mounted on the `/local` mount point on *server1* via *fstab*. Ensure there is no conflict in configuration or functionality between the 2:
	    ```shell
		dnf install autofs -y
		mkdir /autodir
		vi /etc/auto.master
		# add line
		#/- /etc/auto.master.d/auto.dir
		vi /etc/auto.master.d/auto.dir

		#/autodir 172.25.1.4:/common
		systemctl restart autofs
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Exercise 16-4: Access NFS Share Using Indirect Map

	* Configure an indirect map to automount the NFS share `/common` that is available from *server2*. Install the relevant software and set up AutoFS maps to support the automatic mounting. Observe that the specified mount point "autoindir" is created automatically under `/misc`. Note that `/common` is already mounted on the `/local` mount point on *server1* via *fstab*. Ensure there is no conflict in configuration or functionality between the 2:
	    ```shell
		dnf install autofs -y
		grep /misc /etc/auto.master # confirm entry is there
		vi /etc/auto.misc
		# add line
		#autoindir 172.25.1.4:/common
		systemctl restart autofs
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Exercise 16-5: Automount User Home Directories Using Indirect Map

	* On *server1* (NFS server), create a user account called *user30* with UID 3000. Add the `/home` directory to the list of NFS shares so that it becomes available for remote mount. On *server2* (NFS client), create a user account called *user30* with UID 3000, base directory `/nfshome`, and no user home directory. Create an umbrella mount point called `/nfshome` for mounting the user home directory from the NFS server. Install the relevent software and establish an indirect map to automount the remote home directory of *user30* under `/nfshome`. Observe that the home directory of *user30* is automounted under `/nfshome` when you sign in as *user30*:
	    ```shell
		# on server 1 (NFS server)
		useradd -u 3000 user30
		echo password1 | passwd --stdin user30
		vi /etc/exports
		# add line
		#/home *(rw)
		exportfs -avr

		# on server 2 (NFS client)
		dnf install autofs -y		
		useradd user30 -u 3000 -Mb /nfshome
		echo password1 | passwd --stdin user30
		mkdir /nfshome
		vi /etc/auto.master
		# add line
		#/nfshome /etc/auto.master.d/auto.home
		vi /etc/auto.master.d/auto.home
		# add line
		#* -rw &:/home&
		systemctl enable autofs.service & systemctl start autofs.service
		sudo su - user30
		# confirm home directory is mounted
        ```

		chcon -t public_content_t -R sedir1
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Exercise 21.2: Add and Apply File Context

	* Add the current context on *sedir1* to the SELinux policy database to ensure a relabeling will not reset it to its previous value. Next, you will change the context on the directory to some random values. Restore the default context from the policy database back to the directory recursively:
	    ```shell
		semanage fcontext -a -t public_content_t -s user_u '/tmp/sedir1(/.*)?'
		cat /etc/selinux/targeted/contexts/files/file_contexts.local # view recently added policies
		restorecon -Rv sedir1 # any chcon changes are reverted with this
        ```

		semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8010
		semanage port -l | grep http # list all port settings
		semanage port -d -t http_port_t -p tcp 8010
		semanage port -l | grep http
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Exercise 21.4: Copy Files with and without Context

	* Create a file called *sefile2* under `/tmp` and display its context. Copy this file to the `/etc/default` directory, and observe the change in the context. Remove *sefile2* from `/etc/default`, and copy it again to the same destination, ensuring that the target file receives the source file's context:
	    ```shell
		cd /tmp
		touch sefile2
		ll -Zrt # sefile2 context is unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0
		cp sefile2 /etc/default
		cd /etc/default
		ll -Zrt # sefile2 context is unconfined_u:object_r:etc_t:s0
		rm /etc/default/sefile2
		cp /tmp/sefile2 /etc/default/sefile2 --preserve=context
		ll -Zrt # sefile2 context is unconfined_u:object_r:user_tmp_t:s0
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Exercise 21.5: View and Toggle SELinux Boolean Values

	* Display the current state of the Boolean nfs_export_all_rw. Toggle its value temporarily, and reboot the system. Flip its value persistently after the system has been back up:
	    ```shell
		getsebool nfs_export_all_rw # nfs_export_all_rw --> on
		sestatus -b | grep nfs_export_all_rw # also works
		setsebool nfs_export_all_rw_off
		reboot
		setsebool nfs_export_all_rw_off -P
        ```

1. Prince Bajaj - Managing Containers

	* Download the Apache web server container image (httpd 2.4) and inspect the container image. Check the exposed ports in the container image configuration:
	    ```shell
		# as root
		usermod user1 -aG wheel
		cat /etc/groups | grep wheel # confirm
		
		# as user1
		podman search httpd # get connection refused
		# this was because your VM was setup as an Internal Network and not a NAT network so it couldn't access the internet
		# see result registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		skopeo inspect --creds name:password docker://registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		podman inspect registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		# exposed ports shown as 8080 and 8443
        ```

	* Run the httpd container in the background. Assign the name *myweb* to the container, verify that the container is running, stop the container and verify that it has stopped, and delete the container and the container image:
	    ```shell
		podman run --name myweb -d registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		podman ps # view running containers
		podman stop myweb
		podman ps # view running containers
		podman rm myweb
		podman rmi registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
        ```

	* Pull the Apache web server container image (httpd 2.4) and run the container with the name *webserver*. Configure *webserver* to display content "Welcome to container-based web server". Use port 3333 on the host machine to receive http requests. Start a bash shell in the container to verify the configuration:
	    ```shell
		# as root
		dnf install httpd -y
		vi /var/www/html/index.html
		# add row "Welcome to container-based web server"

		# as user1
		podman search httpd
		podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		podman inspect registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7 # shows 8080 in exposedPorts, and /opt/rh/httpd24/root/var/www is shown as HTTPD_DATA_ORIG_PATH 
		podman run -d=true -p 3333:8080 --name=webserver -v /var/www/html:/opt/rh/httpd24/root/var/www/html registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		curl http://localhost:3333 # success!
				
		# to go into the container and (for e.g.) check the SELinux context
		podman exec -it webserver /bin/bash
		cd /opt/rh/httpd24/root/var/www/html
		ls -ldZ

		# you can also just go to /var/www/html/index.html in the container and change it there
        ```

	* Configure the system to start the *webserver* container at boot as a systemd service. Start/enable the systemd service to make sure the container will start at book, and reboot the system to verify if the container is running as expected:
	    ```shell
		# as root
		podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		vi /var/www/html/index
		# add row "Welcome to container-based web server"
		podman run -d=true -p 3333:8080/tcp --name=webserver -v /var/www/html:/opt/rh/httpd24/root/var/www/html registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		cd /etc/systemd/system
		podman generate systemd webserver >> httpd-container.service
		systemctl daemon-reload
		systemctl enable httpd-container.service --now
		reboot
		systemctl status httpd-container.service
		curl http://localhost:3333 # success

		# this can also be done as a non-root user
		podman pull registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		sudo vi /var/www/html/index.html
		# add row "Welcome to container-based web server"
		sudo setsebool -P container_manage_cgroup true
		podman run -d=true -p 3333:8080/tcp --name=webserver -v /var/www/html:/opt/rh/httpd24/root/var/www/html registry.access.redhat.com/rhscl/httpd-24-rhel7
		podman generate systemd webserver > /home/jr/.config/systemd/user/httpd-container.service
		cd /home/jr/.config/systemd/user
		sudo semanage fcontext -a -t systemd_unit_file_t httpd-container.service
		sudo restorecon httpd-container.service
		systemctl enable --user httpd-container.service --now
        ```

	* Pull the *mariadb* image to your system and run it publishing the exposed port. Set the root password for the mariadb service as *mysql*. Verify if you can login as root from local host:
	    ```shell
		# as user1
		sudo dnf install mysql -y
		podman search mariadb
		podman pull docker.io/library/mariadb
		podman inspect docker.io/library/mariadb # ExposedPorts 3306 
		podman run --name mariadb -d -p 3306:3306 -e MYSQL_ROOT_PASSWORD=mysql docker.io/library/mariadb
		podman inspect mariadb # IPAddress is 10.88.0.22
		mysql -h 10.88.0.22 -u root -p
        ```

1. Linux Hint - Bash Script Examples

	* Create a hello world script:
	    ```shell
		!#/bin/bash
		echo "Hello World!"
		exit
        ```

	* Create a script that uses a while loop to count to 5:
	    ```shell
		!#/bin/bash
		count=0
		while [ $count -le 5 ]
		do
			echo "$count"
			count = $(($count + 1))
		done
		exit
        ```

	* Note the formatting requirements. For example, there can be no space between the equals and the variable names, there must be a space between the "]" and the condition, and there must be 2 sets of round brackets in the variable incrementation.

	* Create a script that uses a for loop to count to 5:
	    ```shell
		!#/bin/bash
		count=5
		for ((i=1; i<=$count; i++))
		do
			echo "$i"
		done
		exit
        ```

	* Create a script that uses a for loop to count to 5 printing whether the number is even or odd:
	    ```shell
		!#/bin/bash
		count=5
		for ((i=1; i<=$count; i++))
		do
			if [ $(($i%2)) -eq 0 ]
			then
				echo "$i is even"
			else
				echo "$i is odd"
			fi
		done
		exit
        ```

	* Create a script that uses a for loop to count to a user defined number printing whether the number is even or odd:
	    ```shell
		!#/bin/bash
		echo "Enter a number: "
		read count
		for ((i=1; i<=$count; i++))
		do
			if [ $(($i%2)) -eq 0 ]
			then
				echo "$i is even"
			else
				echo "$i is odd"
			fi
		done
		exit
        ```

	* Create a script that uses a function to multiply 2 numbers together:
	    ```shell
		!#/bin/bash
		Rectangle_Area() {
			area=$(($1 * $2))
			echo "Area is: $area"
		}
		
		Rectangle_Area 10 20
		exit
        ```

	* Create a script that uses the output of another command to make a decision:
	    ```shell
		!#/bin/bash
		ping -c 1 $1 > /dev/null 2>&1
		if [ $? -eq 0 ]
		then
			echo "Connectivity to $1 established"
		else
			echo "Connectivity to $1 unavailable"
		fi
		exit
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Sample RHCSA Exam 1

	* Setup a virtual machine RHEL 8 Server for GUI. Add a 10GB disk for the OS and use the default storage partitioning. Add 2 300MB disks. Add a network interface, but do not configure the hostname and network connection.

	* Assuming the root user password is lost, reboot the system and reset the root user password to root1234:
	    ```shell
		# ctrl + e after reboot
		# add rd.break after Linux line
		# ctrl + d
		mount -o remount, rw /sysroot
		chroot /sysroot
		passwd
		# change password to root12345
		touch /.autorelabel
		exit
		reboot
        ```

	* Using a manual method (i.e. create/modify files by hand), configure a network connection on the primary network device with IP address 192.168.0.241/24, gateway 192.168.0.1, and nameserver 192.168.0.1:
	    ```shell
		vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3
		systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
		# add line IPADDR=192.168.0.241
		# add line GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
		# add line DNS=192.168.0.1
		# add line PREFIX=24
		# change BOOTPROTO from dhcp to none
		ifup enp0s3
		nmcli con show # validate
        ```

	* Using a manual method (modify file by hand), set the system hostname to rhcsa1.example.com and alias rhcsa1. Make sure the new hostname is reflected in the command prompt:
	    ```shell
		vi /etc/hostname
		# replace line with rhcsa1.example.com
		vi /etc/hosts
		# add rhcsa1.example.com and rhcsa1 to first line
		systemctl restart NetworkManager.service
		vi ~/.bashrc
		# add line export PS1 = <($hostname)>
        ```

	* Set the default boot target to multi-user:
	    ```shell
		systemctl set-default multi-user.target
        ```

	* Set SELinux to permissive mode:
	    ```shell
		setenforce permissive
		sestatus # confirm
		vi /etc/selinux/config
		# change line SELINUX=permissive for permanence
        ```

	* Perform a case-insensitive search for all lines in the `/usr/share/dict/linux.words` file that begin with the pattern "essential". Redirect the output to `/tmp/pattern.txt`. Make sure that empty lines are omitted:
	    ```shell
		grep '^essential' /usr/share/dict/linux.words > /tmp/pattern.txt
        ```

	* Change the primary command prompt for the root user to display the hostname, username, and current working directory information in that order. Update the per-user initialisation file for permanence:
	    ```shell
		vi /root/.bashrc
		# add line export PS1 = '<$(whoami) on $(hostname) in $(pwd)>'$
        ```

	* Create user accounts called user10, user20, and user30. Set their passwords to Temp1234. Make accounts for user10 and user30 to expire on December 31, 2021:
	    ```shell
		useradd user10
		useradd user20
		useradd user30
		passwd user10 # enter password
		passwd user20 # enter password
		passwd user30 # enter password
		chage -E 2021-12-31 user10
		chage -E 2021-12-31 user30
		chage -l user10 # confirm
        ```

	* Create a group called group10 and add users user20 and user30 as secondary members:
	    ```shell
		groupadd group10
		usermod -aG group10 user20
		usermod -aG group10 user30
		cat /etc/group | grep "group10" # confirm
        ```

	* Create a user account called user40 with UID 2929. Set the password to user1234:
	    ```shell
		useradd -u 2929 user40
		passwd user40 # enter password
        ```

	* Create a directory called dir1 under `/tmp` with ownership and owning groups set to root. Configure default ACLs on the directory and give user user10 read, write, and execute permissions:
	    ```shell
		mkdir /tmp/dir1
		cd /tmp
		# tmp already has ownership with root
		setfacl -m u:user10:rwx dir1
        ```

	* Attach the RHEL 8 ISO image to the VM and mount it persistently to `/mnt/cdrom`. Define access to both repositories and confirm:
	    ```shell
		# add ISO to the virtualbox optical drive
		mkdir /mnt/cdrom
		mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom
		vi /etc/yum.repos.d/image.repo
		blkid /dev/sr0 >> /etc/fstab
		vi /etc/fstab
		# format line with UUID /mnt/cdrom iso9660 defaults 0 0
		# contents of image.repo
		#####
        #[BaseOS]
		#name=BaseOS
		#baseurl=file:///mnt/cdrom/BaseOS
		#enabled=1

		#gpgenabled=1
		#gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
        #####
		yum repolist # confirm
        ```

	* Create a logical volume called lvol1 of size 300MB in vgtest volume group. Mount the Ext4 file system persistently to `/mnt/mnt1`:
	    ```shell
		mkdir /mnt/mnt1
		# /dev/sdb is already 300MB so don't need to worry about partitioning
		vgcreate vgtest /dev/sdb
		lvcreate --name lvol1 -L 296MB vgtest
		lsblk # confirm
		mkfs.ext4 /dev/mapper/vgtest-lvol1
		vi /etc/fstab
		# add line
		# /dev/mapper/vgtest-lvol1 /mnt/mnt1 ext4 defaults 0 0
		mount -a
		lsblk # confirm
        ```

	* Change group membership on `/mnt/mnt1` to group10. Set read/write/execute permissions on `/mnt/mnt1` for group members, and revoke all permissions for public:
	    ```shell
		chgrp group10 /mnt/mnt1
		chmod 770 /mnt/mnt1
        ```

	* Create a logical volume called lvswap of size 300MB in the vgtest volume group. Initialise the logical volume for swap use. Use the UUID and place an entry for persistence:
	    ```shell
		# /dev/sdc is already 300MB so don't need to worry about partitioning
		vgcreate vgswap /dev/sdc
		lvcreate --name lvswap -L 296MB vgswap /dev/sdc
		mkswap /dev/mapper-vgswap-lvswap # UUID returned
		blkid /dev/sdc >> /etc/fstab
		# organise new line so that it has UUID= swp swap defaults 0 0
		swapon -a
		lsblk # confirm
        ```

	* Use tar and bzip2 to create a compressed archive of the `/etc/sysconfig` directory. Store the archive under `/tmp` as etc.tar.bz2:
	    ```shell
		tar -cvzf /tmp/etc.tar.bz2 /etc/sysconfig
        ```

	* Create a directory hierarchy `/dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4`, and apply SELinux contexts for `/etc` on it recursively:
	    ```shell
		mkdir -p /dir1/dir2/dir3/dir4
		ll -Z 
		# etc shown as system_u:object_r:etc_t:s0
		# dir1 shown as unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0
		semanage fcontext -a -t etc_t "/dir1(/.*)?"
		restorecon -R -v /dir1
		ll -Z # confirm
        ```

	* Enable access to the atd service for user20 and deny for user30:
	    ```shell
		echo "user30" >> /etc/at.deny
		# just don't create at.allow
        ```

	* Add a custom message "This is the RHCSA sample exam on $(date) by $LOGNAME" to the `/var/log/messages` file as the root user. Use regular expression to confirm the message entry to the log file:
	    ```shell
		logger "This is the RHCSA sample exam on $(date) by $LOGNAME"
		grep "This is the" /var/log/messages
        ```

	* Allow user20 to use sudo without being prompted for their password:
	    ```shell
		usermod -aG wheel user20
		# still prompts for password, could change the wheel group behaviour or add new line to sudoers
		visudo
		# add line at end user20 ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Sample RHCSA Exam 2

	* Setup a virtual machine RHEL 8 Server for GUI. Add a 10GB disk for the OS and use the default storage partitioning. Add 1 400MB disk. Add a network interface, but do not configure the hostname and network connection.

	* Using the nmcli command, configure a network connection on the primary network device with IP address 192.168.0.242/24, gateway 192.168.0.1, and nameserver 192.168.0.1:
	    ```shell
		nmcli con add ifname enp0s3 con-name mycon type ethernet ip4 192.168.0.242/24 gw4 192.168.0.1 ipv4.dns "192.168.0.1"
		# man nmcli-examples can be referred to if you forget format
		nmcli con show mycon | grep ipv4 # confirm
        ```
	
	* Using the hostnamectl command, set the system hostname to rhcsa2.example.com and alias rhcsa2. Make sure that the new hostname is reflected in the command prompt:
	    ```shell
		hostnamectl set-hostname rhcsa2.example.com
		hostnamectl set-hostname --static rhcsa2 # not necessary due to format of FQDN
		# the hostname already appears in the command prompt
        ```

	* Create a user account called user70 with UID 7000 and comments "I am user70". Set the maximum allowable inactivity for this user to 30 days:
	    ```shell
		useradd -u 7000 -c "I am user70" user70
		chage -I 30 user70
        ```

	* Create a user account called user50 with a non-interactive shell:
	    ```shell
		useradd user50 -s /sbin/nologin
        ```

	* Create a file called testfile1 under `/tmp` with ownership and owning group set to root. Configure access ACLs on the file and give user10 read and write access. Test access by logging in as user10 and editing the file:
	    ```shell
		useradd user10
		passwd user10 # set password
		touch /tmp/testfile1
		cd /tmp
		setfacl -m u:user10:rw testfile1
		sudo su user10
		vi /tmp/testfile1 # can edit the file
        ```

	* Attach the RHEL 8 ISO image to the VM and mount it persistently to `/mnt/dvdrom`. Define access to both repositories and confirm:
	    ```shell
		mkdir /mnt/dvdrom
		lsblk # rom is at /dev/sr0
		mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/dvdrom
		blkid /dev/sr0 >> /etc/fstab
		vi /etc/fstab
		# format line with UUID /mnt/dvdrom iso9660 defaults 0 0
		vi /etc/yum.repos.d/image.repo
		# contents of image.repo

		#gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
        #####
		yum repolist # confirm
        ```

	* Create a logical volume called lv1 of size equal to 10 LEs in vg1 volume group (create vg1 with PE size 8MB in a partition on the 400MB disk). Initialise the logical volume with XFS file system type and mount it on `/mnt/lvfs1`. Create a file called lv1file1 in the mount point. Set the file system to automatically mount at each system reboot:
	    ```shell
		parted /dev/sdb
		mklabel msdos
		mkpart
		# enter primary
		# enter xfs
		# enter 0
		# enter 100MB
		vgcreate vg1 -s 8MB /dev/sdb1
		lvcreate --name lv1 -l 10 vg1 /dev/sdb1
		mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/vg1-lv1
		mkdir /mnt/lvfs1
		vi /etc/fstab
		# add line for /dev/mapper/vg1-lv1 /mnt/lvfs1 xfs defaults 0 0
		mount -a
		df -h  # confirm
		touch /mnt/lvfs1/hi
        ```

	* Add a group called group20 and change group membership on `/mnt/lvfs1` to group20. Set read/write/execute permissions on `/mnt/lvfs1` for the owner and group members, and no permissions for others:
	    ```shell
		groupadd group20
		chgrp group20 -R /mnt/lvfs1
		chmod 770 -R /mnt/lvfs1
        ```

	* Extend the file system in the logical volume lv1 by 64MB without unmounting it and without losing any data:
	    ```shell
		lvextend -L +64MB vg1/lv1 /dev/sdb1
		# realised that the partition of 100MB isn't enough
		parted /dev/sdb
		resizepart
		# expand partition 1 to 200MB
		pvresize /dev/sdb1
		lvextend -L +64MB vg1/lv1 /dev/sdb1
        ```

	* Create a swap partition of size 85MB on the 400MB disk. Use its UUID and ensure it is activated after every system reboot:
	    ```shell
		parted /dev/sdb
		mkpart
		# enter primary
		# enter linux-swap
		# enter 200MB
		# enter 285MB
		mkswap /dev/sdb2
		vi /etc/fstab
		# add line for UUID swap swap defaults 0 0
		swapon -a
        ```

	* Create a disk partition of size 100MB on the 400MB disk and format it with Ext4 file system structures. Assign label stdlabel to the file system. Mount the file system on `/mnt/stdfs1` persistently using the label. Create file stdfile1 in the mount point:
	    ```shell
		parted /dev/sdb
		mkpart
		# enter primary
		# enter ext4
		# enter 290MB
		# enter 390MB
		mkfs.ext4 -L stdlabel /dev/sdb3
		mkdir /mnt/stdfs1
		vi /etc/fstab
		# add line for UUID /mnt/stdfs1 ext4 defaults 0 0
		touch /mnt/stdfs1/hi
        ```

	* Use tar and gzip to create a compressed archive of the `/usr/local` directory. Store the archive under `/tmp` using a filename of your choice:
	    ```shell
		tar -czvf /tmp/local.tar.gz /usr/local
        ```

	* Create a directory `/direct01` and apply SELinux contexts for `/root`:
	    ```shell
		mkdir /direct01
		ll -Z
		# direct01 has unconfined_u:object_r:default_t:s0
		# root has system_u:object_r:admin_home_t:s0
		semanage fcontext -a -t admin_home_t -s system_u "/direct01(/.*)?" 
		restorecon -R -v /direct01
		ll -Zrt # confirm
        ```

	* Set up a cron job for user70 to search for core files in the `/var` directory and copy them to the directory `/tmp/coredir1`. This job should run every Monday at 1:20 a.m:
	    ```shell
		mkdir /tmp/coredir1
		crontab -u user70 -e
		20 1 * * Mon find /var -name core -type f exec cp '{}' /tmp/coredir1 \;
		crontab -u user70 -l # confirm
        ```

	* Search for all files in the entire directory structure that have been modified in the past 30 days and save the file listing in the `/var/tmp/modfiles.txt` file:
	    ```shell
		find / -mtime -30 >> /var/tmp/modfiles.txt
        ```

	* Modify the bootloader program and set the default autoboot timer value to 2 seconds:
	    ```shell
		vi /etc/default/grub
		# set GRUB_TIMEOUT=2
		grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
        ```

	* Determine the recommended tuning profile for the system and apply it:
	    ```shell
		tuned-adm recommend
		# virtual-guest is returned
		tuned-adm active
		# virtual-guest is returned
		# no change required
        ```

	* Configure Chrony to synchronise system time with the hardware clock:
	    ```shell
		systemctl status chronyd.service
		vi /etc/chrony.conf
		# everything looks alright
        ```

	* Install package group called "Development Tools", and capture its information in `/tmp/systemtools.out` file:
	    ```shell
		yum grouplist # view available groups
		yum groupinstall "Development Tools" -y >> /tmp/systemtools.out
        ```

	* Lock user account user70. Use regular expressions to capture the line that shows the lock and store the output in file `/tmp/user70.lock`:
	    ```shell
		usermod -L user70
		grep user70 /etc/shadow >> /tmp/user70.lock # observe !
        ```

1. Asghar Ghori - Sample RHCSA Exam 3

	* Build 2 virtual machines with RHEL 8 Server for GUI. Add a 10GB disk for the OS and use the default storage partitioning. Add 1 4GB disk to VM1 and 2 1GB disks to VM2. Assign a network interface, but do not configure the hostname and network connection.

	* The VirtualBox Network CIDR for the NAT network is 192.168.0.0/24.

	* On VM1, set the system hostname to rhcsa3.example.com and alias rhcsa3 using the hostnamectl command. Make sure that the new hostname is reflected in the command prompt:
	    ```shell
		hostnamectl set-hostname rhcsa3.example.com
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, configure a network connection on the primary network device with IP address 192.168.0.243/24, gateway 192.168.0.1, and nameserver 192.168.0.1 using the nmcli command:
	    ```shell
		nmcli con add type ethernet ifname enp0s3 con-name mycon ip4 192.168.0.243/24 gw4 192.168.0.1 ipv4.dns 192.168.0.1
        ```

	* On VM2, set the system hostname to rhcsa4.example.com and alias rhcsa4 using a manual method (modify file by hand). Make sure that the new hostname is reflected in the command prompt:
	    ```shell
		vi /etc/hostname
		# change to rhcsa4.example.com
        ```

	* On rhcsa4, configure a network connection on the primary network device with IP address 192.168.0.244/24, gateway 192.168.0.1, and nameserver 192.168.0.1 using a manual method (create/modify files by hand):
	    ```shell
		vi /etc/sysconfig/network-scripts/ifcfg-enp0s3
		#TYPE=Ethernet
		#BOOTPROTO=static
		#DEFROUTE=yes
		#IPV4_FAILURE_FATAL=no
		#IPV4INIT=no
		#NAME=mycon
		#DEVICE=enp0s3
		#ONBOOT=yes
		#IPADDR=192.168.0.243
		#PREFIX=24
		#GATEWAY=192.168.0.1
		#DNS1=192.168.0.1
		ifup enp0s3
		nmcli con edit enp0s3 # play around with print ipv4 etc. to confirm settings
        ```

	* Run "ping -c2 rhcsa4" on rhcsa3. Run "ping -c2 rhcsa3" on rhcsa4. You should see 0% loss in both outputs:
	    ```shell
		# on rhcsa3
		vi /etc/hosts
		# add line 192.168.0.244 rhcsa4
		ping rhcsa3 # confirm
		
		# on rhcsa4
		vi /etc/hosts
		# add line 192.168.0.243 rhcsa3
		ping rhcsa4 # confirm
        ```

	* On rhcsa3 and rhcsa4, attach the RHEL 8 ISO image to the VM and mount it persistently to `/mnt/cdrom`. Define access to both repositories and confirm:
	    ```shell
		# attach disks in VirtualBox
		# on rhcsa3 and rhcsa4
		mkdir /mnt/cdrom
		mount /dev/sr0 /mnt/cdrom
		blkid # get UUID
		vi /etc/fstab
		# add line with UUID /mnt/cdrom iso9660 defaults 0 0
		mount -a # confirm
		vi /etc/yum.repos.d/image.repo
		#####
        #[BaseOS]
		#name=BaseOS
		#baseurl=file:///mnt/cdrom/BaseOS
		#enabled=1
		#gpgenabled=1
		#gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
		#
        #[AppStream]
		#name=AppStream
		#baseurl=file:///mnt/cdrom/AppStream
		#enabled=1
		#gpgenabled=1
		#gpgkey=file:///etc/pki/rpm-gpg/RPM-GPG-KEY-redhat-release
        #####
		yum repolist # confirm
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, add HTTP port 8300/tcp to the SELinux policy database:
	    ```shell
		semange port -l | grep http # 8300 not in list for http_port_t
		semanage port -a -t http_port_t -p tcp 8300
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, create VDO volume vdo1 on the 4GB disk with logical size 16GB and mounted with Ext4 structures on `/mnt/vdo1`:
	    ```shell
		TBC
        ```

	* Configure NFS service on rhcsa3 and share `/rh_share3` with rhcsa4. Configure AutoFS direct map on rhcsa4 to mount `/rh_share3` on `/mnt/rh_share4`. User user80 (create on both systems) should be able to create files under the share on the NFS server and under the mount point on the NFS client:
	    ```shell
		# on rhcsa3
		mkdir /rh_share3
		chmod 777 rh_share3
		useradd user80
		passwd user80
		# enter Temp1234
		dnf install cifs-utils -y
		systemctl enable nfs-server.service --now
		firewall-cmd --add-service=nfs --permanent
		firewall-cmd --reload
		vi /etc/exports
		# add line rh_share3 rhcsa4(rw)
		exportfs -av
		
		# on rhcsa4
		useradd user80
		passwd user80
		# enter Temp1234
		mkdir /mnt/rh_share4
		chmod 777 rh_share4
		# mount rhcsa3:/rh_share3 /mnt/nfs
		# mount | grep nfs # get details for /etc/fstab
		# vi /etc/fstab
		# add line rhcsa3:/rh_share3 /mnt/rh_share4 nfs4 _netdev 0 0
		# above not required with AutoFS
		dnf install autofs -y
		vi /etc/auto.master
		# add line /mnt/rh_rhcsa3 /etc/auto.master.d/auto.home
		vi /etc/auto.master.d/auto.home
		# add line * -rw rhcsa3:/rh_share3
        ```

	* Configure NFS service on rhcsa4 and share the home directory for user user60 (create on both systems) with rhcsa3. Configure AutoFS indirect map on rhcsa3 to automatically mount the home directory under `/nfsdir` when user60 logs on to rhcsa3:
	    ```shell
		# on rhcsa3
		useradd user60
		passwd user60
		# enter Temp1234
		dnf install autofs -y
		mkdir /nfsdir
		vi /etc/auto.master
		# add line for /nfsdir /etc/auto.master.d/auto.home
		vi /etc/auto.master.d/auto.home
		# add line for * -rw rhcsa4:/home/user60
		systemctl enable autofs.service --now

		# on rhcsa4
		useradd user60
		passwd user60
		# enter Temp1234
		vi /etc/exports
		# add line for /home rhcsa3(rw)
		exportfs -va	
        ```

	* On rhcsa4, create Stratis pool pool1 and volume str1 on a 1GB disk, and mount it to `/mnt/str1`:
	    ```shell
		dnf provides stratis
		dnf install stratis-cli -y
		systemctl enable stratisd.service --now
		stratis pool create pool1 /dev/sdc
		stratis filesystem create pool1 vol1
		mkdir /mnt/str1
		mount /stratis/pool1/vol1 /mnt/str1
		blkid # get information for /etc/fstab
		vi /etc/fstab
		# add line for UUID /mnt/str1 xfs defaults 0 0	
        ```

	* On rhcsa4, expand Stratis pool pool1 using the other 1GB disk. Confirm that `/mnt/str1` sees the storage expansion:
	    ```shell
		stratis pool add-data pool1 /dev/sdb
		stratis blockdev # extra disk visible
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, create a group called group30 with GID 3000, and add user60 and user80 to this group. Create a directory called `/sdata`, enable setgid bit on it, and add write permission bit for the group. Set ownership and owning group to root and group30. Create a file called file1 under `/sdata` as user user60 and modify the file as user80 successfully:
	    ```shell
		TBC
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, create directory `/dir1` with full permissions for everyone. Disallow non-owners to remove files. Test by creating file `/tmp/dir1/stkfile1` as user60 and removing it as user80:
	    ```shell
		TBC
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, search for all manual pages for the description containing the keyword "password" and redirect the output to file `/tmp/man.out`:
	    ```shell
		man -k password >> /tmp.man.out
		# or potentially man -wK "password" if relying on the description is not enough
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, create file lnfile1 under `/tmp` and create one hard link `/tmp/lnfile2` and one soft link `/boot/file1`. Edit lnfile1 using the links and confirm:
	    ```shell
		cd /tmp
		touch lnfile1
		ln lnfile1 lnfile2
		ln -s /boot/file1 lnfile1
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, install module postgresql version 9.6:
	    ```shell
		dnf module list postgresql # stream 10 shown as default
		dnf module install postgresql:9.6
		dnf module list # stream 9.6 shown as installed
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, add the http service to the "external" firewalld zone persistently:
	    ```shell
		firewall-cmd --zone=external --add-service=http --permanent
        ```

	* On rhcsa3, set SELinux type shadow_t on a new file testfile1 in `/usr` and ensure that the context is not affected by a SELinux relabelling:
	    ```shell
		cd /usr
		touch /usr/testfile1
		ll -Zrt # type shown as unconfined_u:object_r:usr_t:s0
		semange fcontext -a -t /usr/testfile1
		restorecon -R -v /usr/testfile1
        ```

	* Configure password-less ssh access for user60 from rhcsa3 to rhcsa4:
	    ```shell
		sudo su - user60
		ssh-keygen # do not provide a password
		ssh-copy-id rhcsa4 # enter user60 pasword on rhcsa4
        ```

1. RHCSA 8 Practise Exam

	* Interrupt the boot process and reset the root password:
	    ```shell
		# interrupt boot process and add rd.break at end of linux line
		mount -o remount, rw /sysroot
		chroot /sysroot
		passwd 
		# enter new passwd
		touch /.autorelabel
		# you could also add enforcing=0 to the end of the Linux line to avoid having to do this
		# ctrl + D
		reboot
        ```

	* Repos are available from the repo server at http://repo.eight.example.com/BaseOS and http://repo.eight.example.com/AppStream for you to use during the exam. Setup these repos:
	    ```shell
		vi /etc/yum.repos.d/localrepo.repo
		#[BaseOS]
		#name=BaseOS
		#baseurl=http://repo.eight.example.com/BaseOS
		#enabled=1
		#
		#[AppStream]
		#name=AppStream
		#baseurl=http://repo.eight.example.com/AppStream
		#enabled=1
		dnf repolist # confirm
		# you could also use dnf config-manager --add-repo
        ```

	* The system time should be set to your (or nearest to you) timezone and ensure NTP sync is configured:
	    ```shell
		timedatectl set-timezone Australia/Sydney
		timedatectl set-ntp true
		timedatectl status # confirm status
        ```

	* Add the following secondary IP addresses statically to your current running interface. Do this in a way that doesn’t compromise your existing settings:
	    ```shell
		# IPV4 - 10.0.0.5/24
		# IPV6 - fd01::100/64
		nmcli con edit System\ eth0
		goto ipv4.addresses 
		add 10.0.0.5/24
		goto ipv6.addresses 
		add fd01::100/64
		back
		save
		nmcli con edit System\ eth1
		goto ipv4.addresses 
		add 10.0.0.5/24
		goto ipv6.addresses 
		add fd01::100/64
		back
		save
		nmcli con reload
		# enter yes when asked if you want to set to manual
        ```

	* Enable packet forwarding on system1. This should persist after reboot:
	    ```shell
		vi /etc/sysctl.conf
		# add line for net.ipv4.port_forward=1
        ```

	* System1 should boot into the multiuser target by default and boot messages should be present (not silenced):
	    ```shell
		systemctl set-default multi-user.target
		vi /etc/default/grub
		# remove rhgb quiet from GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
		grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg
		reboot
        ```

	* Create a new 2GB volume group named “vgprac”:
	    ```shell
		lsblk
		# /dev/sdb is available with 8GB
		# the file system already has ~36MB in use and is mounted to /extradisk1
		umount /dev/sdb
		parted /dev/sdb
		mklabel
		# enter msdos
		mkpart
		# enter primary
		# enter xfs
		# enter 0
		# enter 2.1GB
		set
		# enter 1
		# enter lvm
		# enter on
		vgcreate vgprac /dev/sdb1
		# enter y to wipe	
        ```

	* Create a 500MB logical volume named “lvprac” inside the “vgprac” volume group:
	    ```shell
		lvcreate --name lvprac -L 500MB vgprac
        ```

	* The “lvprac” logical volume should be formatted with the xfs filesystem and mount persistently on the `/mnt/lvprac` directory:
	    ```shell
		mkdir /mnt/lvprac
		mkfs.xfs /dev/mapper/vgprac-lvprac
		vi /etc/fstab
		# comment out line for old /dev/sdb
		# add line for /dev/mapper/vgprac-lvprac
		mount -a
		df -h # confirm mounted
        ```

	* Extend the xfs filesystem on “lvprac” by 500MB:
	    ```shell
		lvextend -r -L +500MB /dev/vgprac/lvprac
        ```

	* Use the appropriate utility to create a 5TiB thin provisioned volume:
	    ```shell
		lsblk
		# /dev/sdc is available with 8GB
		dnf install vdo kmod-vdo -y
		umount /extradisk2
		vdo create --name=myvolume --device=/dev/sdc --vdoLogicalSize=5T --force
		vi /etc/fstab
		# comment out line for old /dev/sdc
        ```

	* Configure a basic web server that displays “Welcome to the web server” once connected to it. Ensure the firewall allows the http/https services:
	    ```shell
		vi /var/www/html/index.html
		# add line "Welcome to the web server"
		systemctl restart httpd.service
		curl http://localhost
		# success
		# from server1
		curl http://server2.eight.example.com
		# no route to host shown
		# on server2
		firewall-cmd --add-port=80/tcp --permanent
		firewall-cmd --reload
		# from server1
		curl http://server2.eight.example.com
		# success
        ```

	* Find all files that are larger than 5MB in the /etc directory and copy them to /find/largefiles:
	    ```shell
		mkdir -p /find/largefiles
		find /etc/ -size +5M -exec cp {} /find/largefiles \;
		# the {} is substituted by the output of find, and the ; is mandatory for an exec but must be escaped
        ```

	* Write a script named awesome.sh in the root directory on system1. If “me” is given as an argument, then the script should output “Yes, I’m awesome.” If “them” is given as an argument, then the script should output “Okay, they are awesome.” If the argument is empty or anything else is given, the script should output “Usage ./awesome.sh me|them”:
	    ```shell
		vi /awesome.sh
		chmod +x /awesome.sh
		# contents of awesome.sh
		##!/bin/bash
		#if [ $1 = "me" ]; then
		#	echo "Yes, I'm awesome."
		#elif [ $1  = "them"]; then
		#	echo "Okay, they are awesome."
		#else
		#	echo "Usage /.awesome.sh me|them"
		#fi
		#note that = had to be used and not -eq
        ```

	* Create users phil, laura, stewart, and kevin. All new users should have a file named “Welcome” in their home folder after account creation. All user passwords should expire after 60 days and be at least 8 characters in length. Phil and laura should be part of the “accounting” group. If the group doesn’t already exist, create it. Stewart and kevin should be part of the “marketing” group. If the group doesn’t already exist, create it:
	    ```shell
		groupadd accounting
		groupadd marketing
		vi /etc/security/pwquality.conf
		# uncomment out the line that already had minlen = 8
		mkdir /etc/skel/Welcome
		useradd phil -G accounting
		useradd laura -G accounting
		useradd stewart -G marketing
		useradd kevin -G marketing
		chage -M 60 phil
		chage -M 60 laura
		chage -M 60 stewart
		chage -M 60 kevin
		chage -l phil # confirm
		# can also change in /etc/login.defs
        ```

	* Only members of the accounting group should have access to the `/accounting` directory. Make laura the owner of this directory. Make the accounting group the group owner of the `/accounting` directory:
	    ```shell
		mkdir /accounting
		chmod 770 /accounting
		chown laura:accounting /accounting
        ```

	* Only members of the marketing group should have access to the `/marketing` directory. Make stewart the owner of this directory. Make the marketing group the group owner of the `/marketing` directory:
	    ```shell
		mkdir /marketing
		chmod 770 /marketing
		chown stewart:marketing /marketing
        ```

	* New files should be owned by the group owner and only the file creator should have the permissions to delete their own files:
	    ```shell
		chmod +ts /marketing
		chmod +ts /accounting
        ```

	* Create a cron job that writes “This practice exam was easy and I’m ready to ace my RHCSA” to `/var/log/messages` at 12pm only on weekdays:
	    ```shell
		crontab -e
		#* 12 * * 1-5 echo "This practise exam was easy and I'm ready to ace my RHCSA" >> /var/log/messagees
		# you can look at info crontab if you forget the syntax
        ```

### Be able to perform all tasks expected of a Red Hat Certified System Administrator

1. Understand and use essential tools

1. Operate running systems

1. Configure local storage

1. Create and configure file systems

1. Deploy, configure, and maintain systems

1. Manage users and groups

1. Manage security

### Understand core components of Ansible

1. Inventories

    * Inventories are what Ansible uses to locate and run against multiple hosts. The default ansible 'hosts' file is `/etc/ansible/hosts`. The default location of the hosts file can be set in `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`.

    * The file can contain individual hosts, groups of hosts, groups of groups, and host and group level variables. It can also contain variables that determine how you connect to a host.

    * An example of an INI-based host inventory file is shown below:
        ```shell
        mail.example.com

        [webservers]
        web01.example.com
        web02.example.com

        [dbservers]
        db[01:04].example.com
        ```

    * Note that square brackets can be used instead of writing a separate line for each host.

    * An example of a YAML-based host inventory file is shown below:
        ```shell
        all:
            hosts:
                mail.example.com
            children:
                webservers:
                    hosts:
                        web01.example.com
                        web02.example.com
                dbservers:
                    hosts:
                        db[01:04].example.com
        ```

1. Modules

    * Modules are essentially tools for particular tasks. They usually take parameters and return JSON. Modules can be run from the command line or within a playbook. Ansible ships with a significant amount of modules by default, and custom modules can also be written.

1. Variables

    * Variable names should only contain letters, numbers, and underscores. A variable name should also start with a letter. There are three main scopes for variables: Global, Host and Play.

    * Variables are typically used for configuration values and various parameters. They can store the return value of executed commands and may also be dictionaries. Ansible provides a number of predefined variables.

    * An example of INI-based based variables:
        ```shell
        [webservers]
        host1 http_port=80 maxRequestsPerChild=500
        host2 http_port=305 maxRequestsPerChild=600
        ```

    * An example of YAML-based based variables:
        ```shell
        webservers
            host1:
                http_port: 80
                maxRequestsPerChild: 500
            host2:
                http_port: 305
                maxRequestsPerChild: 600
        ```

1. Facts

    * Facts provide certain information about a given target host. They are automatically discovered by Ansible when it reaches out to a host. Facts can be disabled and can be cached for use in playbook executions.

1. Loops

1. Conditional tasks

1. Plays

	* The goal of a play is to map a group of hosts to some well-defined roles. A play can consist of one or more tasks which make calls to Ansible modules.

1. Handling task failure

1. Playbooks

	* A playbook is a series of plays. An example of a playbook:
        ```shell
		---
		- hosts: webservers
		  become: yes
		  tasks:
		    - name: ensure apache is at the latest version
		      yum:
		        name: httpd
		        state: latest
		    - name: write our custom apache config file
		      template:
		        src: /srv/httpd.j2
		        dest: /etc/httpd/conf/httpd.conf
		    - name: ensure that apache is started
		      service:
		        name: httpd
		        state: started
		    - hosts: dbservers
		      become: yes
		      tasks:
		      - name: ensure postgresql is at the latest version
		        yum:
		          name: postgresql
		          state: latest
		      - name: ensure that postgres is started
		        service:
		          name: postgresql
		          state: started
        ```

1. Configuration Files

	* The Ansible configuration files are taken from the below locations in order:
		* ANSIBLE_CONFIG (environment variable)
		* ansible.cfg (in the current directory)
		* `~/.ansible.cfg` (in the home directory)
		* `/etc/ansible/ansible.cfg`

	* A configuration file will not automatically load if it is in a world-writable directory.

	* The ansible-config command can be used to view configurations:
		* list - Prints all configuration options
		* dump - Dumps configuration
		* view - View the configuration file

	* Commonly used settings:
		* inventory - Specifies the default inventory file
		* roles_path - Sets paths to search in for roles
		* forks - Specifies the amount of hosts configured by Ansible at the same time (Parallelism)
		* ansible_managed - Text inserted into templates which indicate that file is managed by Ansible and changes will be overwritten

1. Roles

1. Use provided documentation to look up specific information about Ansible modules and commands

### Use roles and Ansible Content Collections

1. Create and work with roles

1. Install roles and use them in playbooks

1. Install Content Collections and use them in playbooks

1. Obtain a set of related roles, supplementary modules, and other content from content collections, and use them in a playbook.

### Install and configure an Ansible control node

1. Install required packages

	* To install Ansible using dnf:
        ```shell
		subscription-manager repos --list | grep ansible
		# find latest version
		sudo subscription-manager repos --enable ansible-2.8-for-rhel-8-x86_64-rpms
		dnf search ansible
		# confirm available
		dnf install -y ansible
        ```

	* To install Ansible from disk:
        ```shell
		sudo dnf install git
		mkdir ansible
		mkdir git
		cd git
		git clone --single-branch --branch stable -2.8 https://github.com/ansible/ansible.git
		cd ansible
		source ./hacking/env-setup
		# make permanent
		vi ~/.bash_profile
		# add line
		source ~/git/ansible/hacking/env-setup
		pip2.7 install --user -r ./requirements.txt
		# test the installation
		ansible 127.0.0.1 -m ping
        ```

1. Create a static host inventory file

	* An inventory is a list of hosts that Ansible manages. Inventory files may contain hosts, patterns, groups and variables. Multiple inventory files may be specified using a directory. Inventory files may be specified in INI or YAML format.

	* The default location is `/etc/ansible/hosts`. The location can be set in ansible.cfg or specified in the CLI using:
	    ```shell
		ansible -i <filename>
		```

	* Best practices for inventory variables:
		* Variables should be stored in YAML files located relative to the inventory file.
		* Host and group variables should be stored in the host_vars and group_vars directories respectively (the directories need to be created).
		* Variable files should be named after the host or group for which they contain variables (files may end in .yml or .yaml).

1. Create a configuration file

	* An example of creating a custom configuration file, and updating the default configuration file:
		```shell
		cd ansible
		vi ansible.cfg

		### contents of file
		[defaults]

		interpreter_python = auto
		inventory = /home/cloud_user/ansible/inventory/inv.ini
		roles_path = /etc/ansible/roles:/home/cloud_user/ansible/roles
		###

		mkdir roles
		# add property to default ansible.cfg
		sudo vi /etc/ansible/ansible.cfg
		# add line
		interpreter_python = auto
		```

1. Create and use static inventories to define groups of hosts

### Configure Ansible managed nodes

1. Create and distribute SSH keys to managed nodes

	* A control node is any machine with Ansible installed. You can run Ansible commands and playbooks from any control node. A managed node (also sometimes called a "host") is a network device or server you manage with Ansible. Ansible is not installed on managed nodes.

	* The following is an example of generating SSH keys on the control node and distributing them to managed nodes mypearson2c and mypearson3c:
		```shell
		ssh-keygen
		# enter password
		# now we have id.rsa and id_rsa.pub in /home/cloud_user/.ssh/
		ssh-copy-id cloud_user@mspearson2c.mylabserver.com
		# enter password
		ssh-copy-id cloud_user@mspearson3c.mylabserver.com
		# enter password
		```

1. Configure privilege escalation on managed nodes

	* The following is an example of configuring privilege escalation on managed nodes mypearson2c and mypearson3c:
		```shell
		# perform these steps on both mypearson2c and mypearson3c
		sudo visudo
		# add line
		cloud_user ALL=(ALL) NOPASSWD: ALL
		```

1. Deploy files to managed nodes

1. Be able to analyze simple shell scripts and convert them to playbooks

### Run playbooks with Automation content navigator

1. Know how to run playbooks with Automation content navigator

1. Use Automation content navigator to find new modules in available Ansible Content Collections and use them

1. Use Automation content navigator to create inventories and configure the Ansible environment

### Create Ansible plays and playbooks

1. Know how to work with commonly used Ansible modules

	* Commonly used modules include:
		* Ping
			* Validates a server is running and reachable.
			* No required parameters.
		* Setup
			* Gather Ansible facts.
			* No required parameters.
		* Yum
			* Manage packages with the YUM package manager.
			* Common parameters are name and state.
		* Service
			* Control services on remote hosts:
			* Common parameters are name (required), state and enabled.
		* User
			* Manage user accounts and attributes.
			* Common parameters are name (required), state, group and groups.
		* Copy
			* Copy files to a remote host.
			* Common parameters are src, dest (required), owner, group and mode.
		* File
			* Manage files and directories.
			* Common parameters are path (required), state, owner, group and mode.
		* Git
			* Interact with git repositories.
			* Common parameters are repo (required), dest (required) and clone.

1. Use variables to retrieve the results of running a command

	* The register keyword is used to store the results of running a command as a variable. Variables can then be referenced by other tasks in the playbook. Registered variables are only valid on the host for the current playbook run. The return values differ from module to module.

	* A sample playbook register.yml is shown below:
		```shell
		---
		- hosts: mspearson2
		  tasks:
		    - name: create a file
		      file:
		        path: /tmp/testFile
		        state: touch
		      register: var
		    - name: display debug msg
		      debug: msg="Register output is {{ var }}"
		    - name: edit file
		      lineinfile:
		        path: /tmp/testFile
		        line: "The uid is {{ var.uid }} and gid is {{ var.gid }}"
		```

	* This playbook is run using:
		```shell
		ansible-playbook playbooks/register.yml
		```

	* The result stored in `/tmp/testFile` shows the variables for uid and gid.

1. Use conditionals to control play execution

1. Configure error handling

1. Create playbooks to configure systems to a specified state

#### Archive

1. Validate a working configuration using ad hoc Ansible commands
	
	* An ad hoc command is used to execute one line commands. They are useful for non-routine tasks such as file transfers, package management, managing services, user and group management, fact gathering, general system information, software deployment from Git, and playbook creation testing.
 
	* The syntax of an ad hoc command is shown below:
		```shell
		ansible host -i inventory_file -m module -a "arguments"
		```

	* Arguments require double quotes and are space delimited, and commands are executed as the user that is running them. The -b option can be used to execute the command as the root user. The -a option may be used without the -m command to run shell commands.

	* Examples of ad hoc commands are shown below:
		```shell
		# an example for the ping module
		ansible -i inventory/inv.ini all -m ping

		# an example for the setup module against the mypearson2 host
		ansible mypearson2 -i inventory/inv.ini all -m setup

		# an example of a shell command against the mypearson2 host
		ansible mspearson2 -a "ls -l /tmp"

		# an example of a shell command against the labservers group
		ansible labservers -a "ls -l /tmp"
		```

### Script administration tasks

1. Create simple shell scripts

	* The first line of a shell script must include `#!/bin/bash`. Comments can be added by using the # symbol. Execute permissions are required on the script before it can be executed. The script can be executed using the absolute or relative path.

	* A sample shell script is shown below:
	```shell
	#!/bin/bash
	# hello world script
	echo "Hello world!"
	```

	* A sample shell script using a for loop is shown below:
	```shell
	#!/bin/bash
	# for loop
	for i in {1..5}
	do
		echo "Hello $i times!"
	done
	```

1. Create simple shell scripts that run ad hoc Ansible commands

	* A script containing adhoc commands is shown below:
		```shell
		#!/bin/bash
		
		# Create the user matt
		ansible mcpearson3c.mylabserver.com -i /home/cloud_user/ansible/inventory/inv.ini -b -m user -a "name=matt"

		# Create the demo directory in matt's home directory
		ansible mspearson3c.mylabserver.com -i /home/cloud_user/ansible/inventory/inv.ini -b -m file -a "path=/home/matt/demo state=directory owner=matt group=matt mode=0755"

		# Copy testFile to matt's home directory
		ansible mspearson3c.mylabserver.com -i /home/cloud_user/ansible/inventory/inv.ini -b -m copy -a "src=/home/cloud_user/ansible/testFile dest=/home/matt/testFile mode=0644 owner=matt group=matt"

		# Install httpd to the webservers group and start and enable the httpd service
		ansible webservers -i /home/cloud_user/ansible/inventory/inv.ini -b -m yum -a "name=httpd state=latest"
		ansible webservers -i /home/cloud_user/ansible/inventory/inv.ini -b -m service -a "name=httpd state=started enabled=yes"
		```

	* Ad hoc commands can be a powerful tool for running commands across an inventory and getting the desired results. The following example can be run on a host to retrieve log files from multiple managed nodes:
		```shell
		#!/bin/bash

		for i in webserver1 dbserver1 adminserver1;
   		do ssh ansible@$i "sudo tar -czf messages.tar.gz /var/log/messages";
		done
		ansible -m fetch -a "src=/home/ansible/messages.tar.gz dest=/tmp/messages" all
		```
